# Correctness Proofs for Tensor Species Compilation

**Purpose**: Prove that compilation from Fork-Category sheaves to JAX preserves
categorical structure and is sound.

## What We Must Prove

For the compilation to be correct, we need:

1. **Functoriality Preservation**:
   - If F: Fork-Category^op → Set is a functor with F-id and F-∘
   - Then extract-species(F) preserves these laws in JAX
   - Proof: Show that jnp.einsum composition corresponds to F-∘

2. **Sheaf Condition Preservation**:
   - If F(A★) ≅ ∏_{a'→A★} F(a') in Agda
   - Then compiled fork aggregator computes the product
   - Proof: Show learnable monoid implements the product operation

3. **Gradient Correctness**:
   - Gradient of einsum 'ij,jk->ik' is einsum 'ik,jk->ij'
   - Proof: Use categorical duality (permute the feet!)

4. **Completeness**:
   - Every sheaf on Fork-Category can be extracted
   - Proof: Structural induction on Fork-Category objects/morphisms

## Current Status

- [ ] Functoriality preservation proof
- [ ] Sheaf condition preservation proof
- [ ] Gradient correctness proof
- [ ] Completeness proof
- [ ] Soundness: Compiled program behavior matches categorical semantics

Without these proofs, we just have hopeful scaffolding!

## Theorem 1: Functoriality Preservation

If F: C^op → Set is a functor, then the extracted tensor species preserves
composition.

Statement:
  For morphisms f: x → y and g: y → z in Fork-Category,
  F₁(f ∘ g) = F₁(g) ∘ F₁(f)

  If we extract these to einsums e_f and e_g, then:
  einsum(e_f ∘ e_g) ≡ einsum(e_g) ∘ einsum(e_f)

This is the KEY correctness property: composition in JAX matches composition
in the category!

  ### Theorem Statement

  For any two composable morphisms in Fork-Category,
  extraction preserves composition.
  -}
  postulate
    functoriality-preserved :
      ∀ {x y z : C.Ob} (f : C.Hom y z) (g : C.Hom x y) →
      let e_fg = morphism-to-einsum (f C.∘ g)
          e_f = morphism-to-einsum f
          e_g = morphism-to-einsum g
      in {!!}  -- Need to state what it means for einsums to compose!

  {-|
  ### Proof Strategy

  1. Pattern match on Fork-Category morphisms (≤ᶠ constructors)
  2. For each case, show that einsum composition matches categorical composition
  3. Use the fact that F₁(f ∘ g) = F₁(g) ∘ F₁(f) from functor laws

  Example case: ≤ᶠ-trans
  ```agda
  functoriality-preserved (≤ᶠ-trans f g) h =
    morphism-to-einsum (≤ᶠ-trans (≤ᶠ-trans f g) h)
      ≡⟨ einsum-assoc ⟩  -- Associativity of einsum composition
    morphism-to-einsum (≤ᶠ-trans f (≤ᶠ-trans g h))
      ∎
  ```

  **Challenge**: Need to define what einsum composition means!
  Idea: Sequential application, or use einsum string concatenation

## Theorem 2: Sheaf Condition Preservation

For fork vertices A★, the sheaf condition F(A★) ≅ ∏ F(incoming) must be
preserved by compilation.

Statement:
  If F satisfies the sheaf condition at A★ in Agda,
  then the compiled learnable monoid computes the product.

Proof obligation:
  learnable-monoid([x₁, x₂, ...]) ≡ x₁ × x₂ × ...

Where × is the categorical product in Sets (tuple construction).

  {Γ : OrientedGraph o ℓ}

  open ForkMod Γ
  private
    C = Fork-Category Γ
    module C = Precategory C

  -- Sheaf condition: F(A★) ≅ ∏ F(incoming)
  -- This is the critical property from topos theory!

  postulate
    -- The sheaf condition as an isomorphism
    sheaf-condition :
      ∀ (a : C.Ob) (conv : ForkVertex → Set ℓ) →
      {!!}  -- F(fork-star a conv) ≅ product of F(incoming vertices)

  {-|
  ### Theorem Statement

  The learnable monoid aggregator implements the categorical product.
  -}
  postulate
    monoid-implements-product :
      ∀ (a : C.Ob) (inputs : List (Functor.F₀ F a)) →
      {!!}  -- aggregate(inputs) ≡ product(inputs)

  {-|
  ### Proof Strategy

  1. Show that learnable monoid satisfies:
     - Associativity: combine(combine(x,y), z) ≡ combine(x, combine(y,z))
     - Commutativity: combine(x, y) ≡ combine(y, x) (up to regularization)
     - Identity: combine(x, ε) ≡ x for some identity element ε

  2. These properties make it a commutative monoid, which is the
     algebraic structure of products in Sets!

  3. Therefore: aggregation via monoid = categorical product

  **Challenge**: Need to formalize the "learned" aspect - the monoid is
  parameterized by MLP weights, so correctness is statistical (holds after training)
  not provable a priori!

  **Solution**: Prove that IF the monoid satisfies associativity + commutativity,
  THEN it implements the product. Training ensures this via regularization.

## Theorem 3: Gradient Correctness

From Dudzik: "The gradient flow through an einsum is an einsum."

Statement:
  For einsum 'ij,jk->ik' with gradient ∂L/∂output,
  the gradient ∂L/∂input is einsum 'ik,jk->ij'

Proof: Categorical duality - transpose the parametric span!
-}

module GradientCorrectness where

  {-|
  ### Parametric Span Representation

  An einsum 'ij,jk->ik' is a span:

      I × J × K
     ↙     ↓     ↘
   I×J    J×K    I×K

  Gradient: permute the feet!

      I × K × J     (swap J and K in apex)
     ↙     ↓     ↘
   I×K    J×K    I×J   (new target!)

  This gives einsum 'ik,jk->ij'
  -}

  -- Einsum duality operation
  postulate
    einsum-dual : EinsumOp → EinsumOp

    -- The dual of an einsum is its gradient
    einsum-dual-is-gradient :
      ∀ (op : EinsumOp) →
      {!!}  -- einsum-dual(op) computes gradient of op

  {-|
  ### Proof Strategy

  1. Represent einsum as parametric span (apex + feet)
  2. Show that permuting feet corresponds to transposition
  3. Use calculus: ∂/∂x (x·y) = y (chain rule becomes foot permutation!)
  4. Verify with concrete examples (matmul, conv, etc.)

  Example: Matrix multiplication
  ```
  Forward: C = A @ B  (einsum 'ij,jk->ik')
  ∂L/∂A = ∂L/∂C @ B^T  (einsum 'ik,jk->ij')  ✓ Feet permuted!
  ∂L/∂B = A^T @ ∂L/∂C  (einsum 'ij,ik->jk')  ✓ Feet permuted!
  ```

  This is a THEOREM, not just an observation!

## Theorem 4: Completeness

Every sheaf on Fork-Category can be extracted to a tensor species.

Statement:
  ∀ (F : Functor (Fork-Category^op) Sets),
  ∃ (S : TensorSpecies), extract-species(F) = S

Proof: Structural induction on Fork-Category.

  ### Enumeration Lemma

  Fork-Category is a finite poset, so we can enumerate all objects and morphisms.
  -}
  postulate
    enumerate-objects : List C.Ob
    enumerate-morphisms : List (Σ[ x ∈ C.Ob ] Σ[ y ∈ C.Ob ] (C.Hom x y))

    finite-fork-category :
      ∀ (x : C.Ob) → x ∈ enumerate-objects

  {-|
  ### Completeness Theorem

  For any functor F, we can extract a complete tensor species.
  -}
  postulate
    extraction-complete :
      ∀ (F : Functor (C ^op) (Sets o)) →
      let S = ExtractSpecies.extract-species Γ F
      in {!!}  -- S contains all objects/morphisms of F

  {-|
  ### Proof Strategy

  1. For each object c ∈ enumerate-objects:
     - Create IndexVar from c
     - Extract dimension from F₀(c)

  2. For each morphism (x, y, f) ∈ enumerate-morphisms:
     - Convert F₁(f) to einsum via pattern matching on fork morphisms

  3. For each fork-star vertex:
     - Create LearnableMonoid from incoming edges

  4. Verify that all functoriality laws are preserved (Theorem 1)

  This is constructive! We literally enumerate the category and extract.
  -}

{-|
## Theorem 5: Soundness

The compiled JAX program has the same behavior as the categorical semantics.

Statement:
  If F: C^op → Set is a sheaf and S = extract-species(F),
  then for any input x and morphism path p in C,

  JAX_compiled(S)(x, p) ≡ F₁(p)(x)

This is the ULTIMATE correctness property: the compiled code computes
the same function as the categorical definition!

  ### Denotational Semantics

  We need to give semantics to JAX programs in terms of functors.
  -}
  postulate
    -- Interpret JAX einsum as a function
    JAX-einsum-semantics : EinsumOp → (List (Functor.F₀ F _) → Functor.F₀ F _)

    -- The compiled program denotes the functor application
    soundness-theorem :
      ∀ {x y : C.Ob} (f : C.Hom x y) (input : Functor.F₀ F y) →
      let e = morphism-to-einsum f
          jax-result = JAX-einsum-semantics e (input ∷ [])
          agda-result = Functor.F₁ F f input
      in jax-result ≡ agda-result

  {-|
  ### Proof Strategy

  1. Define denotational semantics for JAX operations
     - jnp.einsum('ij,jk->ik', A, B) ≡ matrix multiplication
     - This is compositional!

  2. Show that einsum semantics matches functor application
     - Use Theorem 1 (functoriality preservation)
     - Use Theorem 3 (gradient correctness)

  3. Extend to full programs via composition

  **This proof would be the CROWN JEWEL** - it shows our compilation is
  provably correct, not just hopeful!
  -}

{-|
## What We Need to Complete These Proofs

1. **Formal einsum algebra**: Define composition, duality, etc.
2. **JAX semantics in Agda**: Model JAX operations categorically
3. **Actual extraction implementation**: Fill the {!!} holes in TensorSpecies.agda
4. **Property-based testing**: Test soundness on random inputs

The current code is scaffolding. These proofs make it REAL.
