# Section 3.4: Semantic Information and Homological Constructions

This module implements Section 3.4 from Belfiore & Bennequin (2022), formalizing
homological algebra for neural networks, semantic information measures, and the
connection to integrated information theory (IIT).

## Paper Reference

"The semantic information of a neural network can be measured homologically:
features correspond to cochains, relationships to cocycles, and invariants to
cohomology classes. The Euler characteristic χ(G) of the network graph G
provides a topological invariant of information integration."

"Persistent homology tracks how semantic information emerges across layers:
features appearing at layer U and persisting to layer U' contribute to the
information flow. Barcodes visualize this emergence."

## DNN Interpretation

**Homology of Networks**: Topological features across layers
- 0-dim: individual neurons (connected components)
- 1-dim: cycles in connectivity (feedback loops)
- 2-dim: voids (higher-order structure)
- n-dim: higher coherence

**Applications**:
- Feature persistence: which features survive across layers
- Information integration: how features combine (cohomology)
- Topological regularization: penalize complex topology
- Interpretability: visualize semantic structure
- Robustness: topological features are noise-resistant

## Key Concepts

1. **Chain Complex**: Sequence C₀ ← C₁ ← C₂ ← ... with ∂² = 0
2. **Homology**: H_n = ker(∂_n) / im(∂_{n+1}) (cycles mod boundaries)
3. **Cohomology**: H^n = ker(δ^n) / im(δ^{n-1}) (cocycles mod coboundaries)
4. **Persistent Homology**: Birth/death of features across filtration
5. **Semantic Information**: Measured by cohomological invariants

{-|
## Definition 3.20: Simplicial Complex from Network

> "A neural network G = (V,E) induces a simplicial complex K(G) where:
> - 0-simplices: vertices (neurons)
> - 1-simplices: edges (connections)
> - n-simplices: cliques of size n+1 (fully connected subnetworks)"

**Construction**:
- K₀(G) = V (vertices)
- K₁(G) = E (edges)
- Kₙ(G) = {(v₀,...,vₙ) | all pairs connected}

**DNN Interpretation**: Higher-order interactions
- Neurons: individual features
- Edges: pairwise interactions
- Triangles: three-way interactions
- Tetrahedra: four-way interactions

**Example: Attention Mechanism**
- Query-Key-Value triangle forms 2-simplex
- Multi-head attention: multiple simplices
- Self-attention: cliques within layers

postulate
  DirectedGraph : Type (lsuc lzero)
  Vertices : DirectedGraph → Type
  Edges : DirectedGraph → Type

  -- Simplicial complex structure
  Simplex : DirectedGraph → Nat → Type
  vertices-simplex : ∀ {G} → Simplex G 0 → Vertices G
  edge-simplex : ∀ {G} → Simplex G 1 → Edges G

  -- Face maps (boundary of simplex)
  ∂-face : ∀ {G n} → Simplex G (suc n) → Fin (suc (suc n)) → Simplex G n

## Example 3.19: ResNet Block as Simplicial Complex

A residual block with skip connection:
```
x → conv1 → bn → relu → conv2 → bn → +
↓                                    ↑
└────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Simplicial structure:
- 0-simplices: {x, conv1, bn, relu, conv2, +}
- 1-simplices: {x→conv1, conv1→bn, ..., x→+}
- 2-simplices: {(x, conv1, +), (x, conv2, +)} (triangles involving skip)

The skip connection creates 2-simplices (triangular structure)!

-- § 3.4.2: Chain Complexes and Boundary Operators

{-|
## Definition 3.21: Chain Complex of Network

> "The chain complex C_*(G) is the sequence:
>   ... ← C₂(G) ←∂₂ C₁(G) ←∂₁ C₀(G) ← 0
> where C_n(G) is the free abelian group generated by n-simplices,
> and ∂_n: C_n → C_{n-1} is the boundary operator."

**Boundary Operator**:
```
∂_n(v₀,...,vₙ) = Σᵢ (-1)ⁱ (v₀,...,v̂ᵢ,...,vₙ)
```
where v̂ᵢ means "omit vᵢ".

**Key Property**: ∂² = 0 (boundary of boundary is zero)

**DNN Interpretation**: Information flow
- C_n: n-way interactions
- ∂_n: how interactions decompose into sub-interactions
- ∂² = 0: consistency of decomposition

**Example: Triangle Boundary**
- Triangle (a,b,c)
- Boundary: ∂₂(a,b,c) = (b,c) - (a,c) + (a,b)
- Three edges with orientation

## Definition 3.22: Cochain Complex (Dual)

> "The cochain complex C*(G) is the dual:
>   0 → C⁰(G) →δ⁰ C¹(G) →δ¹ C²(G) → ...
> where C^n(G) = Hom(C_n(G), ℤ) and δ^n is the coboundary."

**Coboundary Operator**:
```
δ^n: C^n → C^{n+1}
(δ^n α)(σ) = α(∂_{n+1} σ)
```

**Key Property**: δ² = 0 (coboundary of coboundary is zero)

**DNN Interpretation**: Feature functionals
- C^n: feature detectors (functions on n-way interactions)
- δ^n: how features extend to higher interactions
- δ² = 0: consistency of extension

**Example: Edge Features → Triangle Features**
- α: edge features (C¹)
- (δα)(triangle): extend to triangle
- (δα)(a,b,c) = α(b,c) - α(a,c) + α(a,b)
- Checks if edge features are consistent on triangle

> - n-cycle: c with ∂c = 0 (closed)

**Interpretation**:
- H₀(G): connected components
- H₁(G): independent cycles (loops)
- H₂(G): voids (cavities)
- H_n(G): n-dimensional holes

**DNN Interpretation**: Irreducible structures
- H₀: number of disconnected subnetworks
- H₁: feedback loops (recurrent connections)
- H₂: higher-order dependencies
- Hₙ: n-way irreducible interactions

**Interpretation**:
- Cocycles: feature combinations that close
- Coboundaries: trivial feature combinations
- Cohomology: non-trivial features

**DNN Interpretation**: Semantic features
- H⁰: global properties (e.g., "contains object")
- H¹: relational properties (e.g., "A is left of B")
- H²: compositional properties (e.g., "scene structure")

Feedforward DAG (no cycles):
- H₀(G) = ℤ (one connected component)
- H₁(G) = 0 (no cycles, acyclic)

Recurrent network with k independent loops:

The rank of H₁ counts feedback loops!
This is crucial for understanding recurrent dynamics.

## Definition 3.25: Filtration by Layer Depth

> "A neural network with depth D induces a filtration:
>   K₀ ⊂ K₁ ⊂ ... ⊂ K_D = K(G)
> where K_d contains all simplices up to layer d."

**Structure**:
- K₀: input layer
- K₁: input + first hidden layer
- K_D: full network

**Persistent Homology**: Track when features appear and disappear
- Birth: layer where feature appears
- Death: layer where feature disappears
- Persistence: death - birth (how long feature survives)

**DNN Interpretation**: Feature lifecycle
- Short persistence: noise, transient features
- Long persistence: stable, semantic features
- Infinite persistence: fundamental network structure
-}

  -- Filtration: increasing sequence of subcomplexes
  Filtration : DirectedGraph → Nat → Type
  filtration-inclusion : ∀ {G d} → Filtration G d → Filtration G (suc d)

  -- Persistent homology at each layer
  Persistent-Homology : DirectedGraph → Nat → Nat → Type
  -- H_n(K_d) for n-th homology at depth d

  -- Birth-death pairs
  Birth-Death : DirectedGraph → Nat → Type
  birth : ∀ {G n} → Birth-Death G n → Nat
  death : ∀ {G n} → Birth-Death G n → Nat
  persistence : ∀ {G n} (bd : Birth-Death G n) → Nat

## Proposition 3.4: Persistence Stability

> "Small perturbations to network weights induce small changes in persistence
> diagrams. Specifically, the bottleneck distance d_B(D, D') ≤ ||W - W'||
> where D, D' are persistence diagrams for weights W, W'."

**Proof Sketch**:
Uses stability theorem from persistent homology theory.

**DNN Interpretation**: Robustness of semantic features
- Persistent features are robust to noise
- Transient features are unstable
- Training increases persistence of meaningful features

**Application: Topological Regularization**
- Add term to loss: λ · Σ (1 / persistence(f))
- Penalizes short-lived features
- Encourages stable semantic structure

{-|
## Example 3.22: Convolutional Network Persistence

Track edge detector emergence:
- Birth at conv1: edge features appear
- Persist through conv2, conv3: edges combine into textures
- Death at conv5: edges integrated into object parts
- Persistence = 4 layers

Long persistence ⇒ fundamental feature (edges are essential for vision).

-- § 3.4.5: Semantic Information Measures

{-|
## Definition 3.26: Homological Information

> "The semantic information of network G is:
>   I_sem(G) = Σ_n rank(H_n(G)) · log(|H_n(G)|)"

**Interpretation**:
- Counts independent semantic features (rank of homology)
- Weights by information content (log of torsion)
- Sum over all dimensions n

**DNN Interpretation**: Capacity for semantic representation
- Higher I_sem ⇒ more semantic distinctions
- Training increases I_sem (learns semantic features)
- Pruning decreases I_sem (removes semantic capacity)

**Connection to IIT**:
Homological information generalizes integrated information Φ:
- Φ measures irreducibility (minimum partition)
- H_n measures n-way irreducible interactions
- Both capture information integration

postulate
  -- Rank of abelian group
  rank : ∀ {A : Type} → {!!} → Nat  -- Rank of homology group

  -- Torsion subgroup size
  torsion-size : ∀ {A : Type} → {!!} → Nat

  -- Semantic information
  Semantic-Information : DirectedGraph → Type
  I-sem : (G : DirectedGraph) → Semantic-Information G
  I-sem-def : ∀ G → {!!}  -- Σ_n rank(H_n) · log(|torsion(H_n)|)

{-|
## Example 3.23: Information Growth During Training

Untrained network:
- Random connections
- Low H₁ (few organized cycles)
- I_sem ≈ 0

After training:
- Structured connections
- High H₁ (functional feedback loops)
- High Hₙ (higher-order features)
- I_sem >> 0

Training maximizes semantic information!
This explains why networks develop interpretable structure.

  example-training-increases-info : ∀ {G_init G_trained : DirectedGraph}

## Definition 3.27: Integrated Information via Homology

>   Φ(G) = min_π [ I_sem(G) - Σᵢ I_sem(Gᵢ) ]
> where π = {G₁, ..., Gₖ} is a partition of G into subnetworks."

**Interpretation**:
- Partition G into subnetworks
- Compare full homology to sum of part homologies
- Minimum over all partitions = integrated information
- Measures irreducibility

**DNN Interpretation**: How much network acts as a whole
- High Φ: strongly integrated (can't be decomposed)
- Low Φ: modular (sum of independent parts)
- Training may increase or decrease Φ (task-dependent)

**Example: Attention = High Φ**
- Attention mechanism: all tokens interact
- Can't partition without losing cross-token information
- High Φ in attention layers

{-|
## Proposition 3.5: Feedforward Networks Have Zero Φ

> "For acyclic feedforward networks G: Φ(G) = 0."

**Proof Sketch**:
1. Partition by layers: G = G₁ ⊔ ... ⊔ G_L
2. Feedforward ⇒ information flows one direction
3. No cycles ⇒ no information integration across partition
4. I_sem(G) = Σᵢ I_sem(Gᵢ)
5. Therefore Φ(G) = 0

**DNN Interpretation**: Feedforward = no integration
- Each layer processes independently
- No global coherence
- This is why recurrent networks are more expressive!
-}

postulate
  proposition-3-5 : ∀ (G : DirectedGraph)
                  → {!!}  -- Acyclic ⇒ Φ(G) = 0

{-|
## Example 3.24: Recurrent Network Φ

LSTM with forget gates:
- High Φ when gate is open (information integrates)
- Low Φ when gate is closed (information blocked)
- Φ(t) varies dynamically with input

The homological measure captures information flow through time!

>   (α ⌣ β)(σ) = α(front_p σ) · β(back_q σ)
> where σ is a (p+q)-simplex, front_p is first p faces, back_q is last q faces."

**Interpretation**:
- α ∈ H^p: p-dimensional feature
- β ∈ H^q: q-dimensional feature
- α ⌣ β ∈ H^{p+q}: combined feature

**DNN Interpretation**: Feature composition
- α: edge detector
- β: texture detector
- α ⌣ β: edge-textured object detector
- Cup product = compositional semantics!

## Example 3.25: Compositional Object Recognition

Features:

Compositions:
- α₁ ⌣ α₃: wheel + chassis → "car body"
- α₂ ⌣ α₃: window + chassis → "car cabin"
- (α₁ ⌣ α₃) ⌣ (α₂ ⌣ α₃): full car

> where E₁^{p,q} = H^q(K_p, K_{p-1}) (relative cohomology)."

**Interpretation**:
- E₁^{p,q}: features born at layer p of dimension q
- Spectral sequence: how features combine across layers
- Convergence: final cohomology H*(K_D)

**DNN Interpretation**: Feature emergence across depth
- Track which features appear at which layer
