# The Poset X of a DNN (Section 1.5, Proposition 1.1)

**Reference**: Belfiore & Bennequin (2022), Section 1.5
arXiv:2106.14587v3 [math.AT]

## Main Results:

**Proposition 1.1**:
(i) CX is a poset
(ii) Every presheaf on C induces a presheaf on CX
(iii) For every presheaf on CX, there exists a unique sheaf on C which induces it

**Corollary**: C∼ is naturally equivalent to the category of presheaves C∧_X

## The Construction:

From the paper:
> "X denotes the set of vertices of the full subcategory CX of C generated by X,
> of type a or of type A (see figure 1.2)."

We remove the A★ (fork-star) vertices from the fork category C to get the poset X = CX.
The key insight is that removing A★ breaks any potential cycles that could arise from
the fork structure, making CX a proper poset.

## Ordering:

From the paper:
> "If x, y belong to X, we note x ≤ y when there exists a morphism from x to y;
> then it is equivalent to write x → y in the category CX."

In our convention (information flows opposite to categorical arrows):
- y ≤ x when there's a path from x to y in the original graph Γ
- Minimal elements: outputs + tips (information sinks)
- Maximal elements: inputs + tangs (information sources)

## Removing Fork-Star Vertices (Definition of X)

The poset X is obtained from the fork category C by removing all A★ vertices.
From Architecture.agda, we have ForkVertex with three constructors:
- original: Layer → ForkVertex
- fork-star: (convergent layer) → ForkVertex  [REMOVED in X]
- fork-tang: (convergent layer) → ForkVertex

We keep only `original` and `fork-tang` vertices.

  ### Ordering on X

  From the paper's proof of Proposition 1.1(i):
  > "let γ₁, γ₂ be two different simple directed paths in CX going from a point z
  > in X to a point x in X..."

  The ordering is given by paths in the forked graph, excluding paths through A★.
  Arrows go OPPOSITE to information flow (categorical convention).

  ## Proposition 1.1(i): CX is a Poset

  **Proof sketch from paper**:
  The key is to show antisymmetry: if x ≤ y and y ≤ x, then x = y.

  From the paper:
  > "let γ₁, γ₂ be two different simple directed paths in CX going from a point z
  > in X to a point x in X, there must exists a first point y where the two paths
  > disjoin, going to two different points y₁, y₂."

  The proof proceeds by contradiction:
  1. Assume x ≤ y and y ≤ x with x ≠ y
  2. There exist paths γ₁: x → y and γ₂: y → x
  3. These paths must diverge and reconverge, creating a potential cycle
  4. Analysis of fork structure shows this is impossible:
     - y cannot be a handle (type a) - it has unique predecessor
     - y cannot be input or tang - they are sources
     - y must be output or tip
  5. At divergence point, one branch must go through a tang A
  6. But then both paths would need to converge at same tang A
  7. This would create oriented loop in original graph Γ
  8. Contradiction with Γ being directed (acyclic)

  Therefore CX is antisymmetric and hence a poset.

  ### X-Poset: The fundamental poset structure

  This is the poset X from the paper. It has the structure:
  - **Minimal elements** (where arrows terminate):
    - Outputs: is-output
    - Tips: vertices feeding into forks
  - **Maximal elements** (where arrows originate):
    - Inputs: is-input

  From the paper:

  ## Proposition 1.1(ii): Presheaf Restriction

  From the paper:
  > "Every presheaf on C induces a presheaf on CX."

  This is straightforward: we simply restrict a presheaf F: C^op → Sets
  to the subcategory CX ⊂ C.

  The functor F(A★) at fork-star vertices is ignored, and we keep only:
  - F(a) for original vertices
  - F(A) for tang vertices

  ## Proposition 1.1(iii): Unique Sheaf Extension

  From the paper's proof:
  > "remark that the vertices which are eliminated in X are the A★. Then consider
  > a presheaf F on X, the sheaf condition over C tells that F(A★) must be the
  > product of the entrant F(a'), ..., then the product map F(A) → F(A★) of the
  > maps F(A) → F(a') gives a sheaf."

  **Key insight**: At each fork with star A★:
  - A★ has incoming arrows from tips a', a'', ...
  - A★ has outgoing arrow to tang A
  - The sheaf condition forces: F(A★) ≅ ∏_{a'→A★} F(a')
  - Since F is given on CX, we have F(a') and F(A)
  - We define F(A★) := ∏ F(a') to satisfy the sheaf condition
  - The maps F(A) → F(a') (induced by A → A★ → a') give the extension

  This extension is unique because:
  1. The sheaf condition uniquely determines F(A★)
  2. The morphism structure is uniquely determined by composition in C

  ## Corollary: Equivalence of Categories

  From the paper:
  > "Corollary. C∼ is naturally equivalent to the category of presheaves C∧_X."

  Where:
  - C∼ = Sh[C, J] is the topos of sheaves on (C, J) with fork topology J
  - C∧_X = [CX^op, Sets] is the category of presheaves on the poset CX

  This follows from Proposition 1.1(iii): the sheaf extension gives a functor
  [CX^op, Sets] → Sh[C, J] that is an equivalence of categories.

  **Intuition**: The fork-stars A★ are "redundant" - they exist only to encode
  the sheaf gluing condition. Once we remove them to get CX, presheaves on CX
  are equivalent to sheaves on C because the sheaf condition at A★ is automatic
  (forced by the structure).

## Summary

This module establishes the fundamental poset structure X = CX:

1. **Construction**: Remove fork-star vertices A★ from fork category C
2. **Ordering**: Paths in forked graph (arrows opposite to information flow)
3. **Proposition 1.1(i)**: X is a poset (antisymmetric by acyclicity of Γ)
4. **Proposition 1.1(ii)**: Presheaves on C restrict to CX
5. **Proposition 1.1(iii)**: Presheaves on CX extend uniquely to sheaves on C
6. **Corollary**: Sh[C, J] ≃ [CX^op, Sets]

This is the foundation for understanding DNNs as topoi: the complicated fork
structure with A★ vertices is equivalent to the simpler poset structure X,
but presheaves must be replaced by sheaves to capture the gluing at convergence
points.

**Next steps** (in Alexandrov.agda):
- Define the Alexandrov (lower) topology on X
- Show that sheaves on (X, Alexandrov) are equivalent to presheaves on X
- Establish the full topos structure
