# Simplicial Homotopy Theory (Foundation for Section 7)

This module provides foundational structures from simplicial homotopy theory
needed for Gamma-spaces and Gamma networks (Section 7 of Manin & Marcolli 2024).

## Overview

**Pointed simplicial sets** are functors Δ^op → Sets* where Δ is the simplex
category and Sets* is pointed sets.

**Key structures**:
1. Pointed simplicial sets PSSet
2. Smash product ∧s on pointed simplicial sets
3. Suspension Susp and spheres Sⁿ
4. Weak homotopy equivalences
5. n-connectivity
6. Homotopy groups πn

Most of these structures are not available in 1Lab, so we postulate them with
careful type signatures that encode the mathematical structure.

## Smash Product

The **smash product** K ∧ L of pointed simplicial sets is the quotient of the
product K × L by the wedge K ∨ L.

Categorically: K ∧ L = (K × L) / (K ∨ L)

This is the monoidal structure on PSSet.

## Suspension and Spheres

The **suspension** Susp(K) of a pointed simplicial set K is the smash product
with the circle S¹.

The **n-sphere** Sⁿ is defined inductively:
- S⁰ = two points with one as basepoint
- Sⁿ⁺¹ = Susp(Sⁿ)

## Weak Homotopy Equivalences

A map f : K → L of pointed simplicial sets is a **weak homotopy equivalence**
if it induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups πn.

We postulate the basic properties without defining homotopy groups explicitly.

    (F : PSSet → PSSet) →
    {-| preserves-weak-equiv F means:
        for all K L : PSSet, f : PSSet-Hom K L,
        is-weak-equiv K L f implies is-weak-equiv (F K) (F L) (F f) -}
    ⊤

## Connectivity

A pointed simplicial set K is **n-connected** if πi(K) = 0 for all i ≤ n.

Equivalently, K is n-connected if the unique map K → * is an n-equivalence.
-}

  is-n-connected : PSSet → Nat → Type

  -- (-1)-connected means non-empty (path-connected with basepoint)
  is-neg1-connected : (K : PSSet) → is-n-connected K zero ≡ {-| non-empty -} ⊤

  connectivity-via-pi :
    (K : PSSet) → (n : Nat) →
    is-n-connected K n ≡ {-| πi(K) = 0 for i ≤ n -} ⊤

  suspension-connectivity :
    (K : PSSet) → (n : Nat) →
    is-n-connected K n →
    is-n-connected (Susp K) (suc n)

  -- Spheres are highly connected: S^(n+1) is n-connected
  sphere-connectivity :
    (n : Nat) →
    is-n-connected (Sⁿ (suc n)) n

## Homotopy Groups

The **n-th homotopy group** πn(K) of a pointed simplicial set K is the group
of homotopy classes of maps Sⁿ → K.

We postulate these without full construction.
-}

postulate

## Simplicial Approximation

Continuous maps between geometric realizations of simplicial sets can be
approximated by simplicial maps up to homotopy.

This is the bridge between simplicial and topological homotopy theory.
-}

postulate
  -- Geometric realization |K| of simplicial set K
  geometric-realization : PSSet → Type₁  -- Topological space

  -- Simplicial approximation theorem
  simplicial-approximation :
    (K L : PSSet) →
    {-| Continuous map between realizations is homotopic to realization of simplicial map -}
    ⊤

## Skeletal Filtration

Every pointed simplicial set K has a skeletal filtration:
  * = Sk₋₁(K) ⊆ Sk₀(K) ⊆ Sk₁(K) ⊆ ... ⊆ K

where Skₙ(K) is the n-skeleton containing all simplices of dimension ≤ n.
-}

postulate
  -- n-skeleton
  Skₙ : Nat → PSSet → PSSet

  -- Skeletal filtration
  skeleton-filtration :
    (n : Nat) → (K : PSSet) →
    PSSet-Hom (Skₙ n K) (Skₙ (suc n) K)

  -- Colimit of skeleta is the simplicial set
  skeleton-colimit :
    (K : PSSet) →
    {-| colimit of skeleta is isomorphic to K -}
    ⊤

{-|
## CW Approximation

Every simplicial set is weakly equivalent to a CW complex via its geometric
realization and cellular approximation.

This connects to classical algebraic topology.
-}

postulate
  -- CW complex structure
  is-CW-complex : PSSet → Type

  -- Every simplicial set has CW approximation
  cw-approximation :
    (K : PSSet) →
    {-| There exists L : PSSet with is-CW-complex L and
        a weak equivalence f : K → L -}
    ⊤

## Physical Interpretation

In the context of neural networks (Section 7):

1. **Simplicial sets model configuration spaces**: The nerve N(ΣC(X)) of summing
   functors gives a simplicial set modeling resource assignments.

2. **Connectivity measures complexity**: Higher connectivity of K(G) (clique
   complex) indicates more complex network topology.

3. **Homotopy groups detect structure**: Non-trivial πn(K(G)) reveals
   n-dimensional "holes" in the network's connectivity pattern.

4. **Suspension increases dimension**: Suspⁿ(K) shifts homotopy groups up by n,
   modeling increased topological complexity.

5. **Smash product combines systems**: K ∧s L models the interaction of two
   subsystems.
