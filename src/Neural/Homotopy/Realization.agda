# Neural Realization of Homotopy Types

This module formalizes the **semantic functor** that interprets DirectedGraphs
as homotopy types, following the pattern established by Delooping.

## The Pattern: Delooping as Template

**Delooping** (from 1Lab):
- Input: Group G (algebraic)
- Output: Space (Deloop G) with π₁ = G (geometric)
- Verification: encode/decode prove G ≃ π₁(Deloop G)

**Neural Realization** (this module):
- Input: DirectedGraph G (combinatorial)
- Output: Semantic type ⟦G⟧ via clique complex K(G) (geometric)
- Verification: π₁(⟦G⟧) computed from graph structure

## Research Goal (Phase 1)

Formalize what it means for a graph to "realize" a homotopy type:

1. **Semantic Functor**: ⟦_⟧ : DirectedGraph → Type
2. **Correctness**: For well-behaved graphs, K(G) ≃ ⟦G⟧
3. **Invariants**: π₁(⟦G⟧) computable from graph cycles

## Semantic Interpretation of Graphs

A DirectedGraph G has a **semantic type** ⟦G⟧ given by its clique complex.

The clique complex K(G) is a presheaf (PSSet), which represents a homotopy type
in the internal language of the (∞,1)-topos of presheaves.

For now, we use PSSet as our semantic domain. Future work will connect this
to actual Type via geometric realization.
-}

-- Semantic interpretation: graph → presheaf
-- (Using semantic instead of ⟦_⟧ to avoid clash with Meta.Brackets)
semantic : DirectedGraph → PSSet
semantic G = K G

## Realization Correctness

A graph G **realizes** a type X if K(G) is equivalent to X.

**Note:** This is the **inverse** of Delooping!
- Delooping: Group → Space (construct space with given π₁)
- Realization: Try to find Graph such that K(Graph) ≃ Space

Not all types are graph-realizable! We need to characterize which are.
-}

-- A graph realizes a type if their semantics are equivalent
Realizes : DirectedGraph → Type → Type
Realizes G X = {!!}  -- Need: PSSet → Type comparison
  -- This requires geometric realization |K(G)| : Type
  -- Postulate for now

postulate
  -- Geometric realization: presheaf → type
  -- (Using geometric-realization to avoid clash with HLevel.Universe)
  geometric-realization : PSSet → Type

-- Now we can define realization properly
Realizes' : DirectedGraph → Type → Type
Realizes' G X = geometric-realization (K G) ≃ X

## The Realization Problem (Inverse Synthesis)

**Input:** Target type X (or its homotopy invariants)
**Output:** DirectedGraph G such that G realizes X
**Verification:** semantic G ≃ X (up to geometric realization)

This is **harder** than Delooping because:
1. Not every type is graph-realizable
2. Multiple graphs may realize the same type
3. Finding the graph is a search problem

**Approach:**
1. Characterize graph-realizable types
2. For realizable X, construct G explicitly
3. Prove Realizes' G X
-}

-- Realizability predicate
GraphRealizable : Type → Type
GraphRealizable X = Σ[ G ∈ DirectedGraph ] (Realizes' G X)

## Fundamental Group and Realization

For K(G,1) spaces (spaces with only π₁ non-trivial), we can use graph cycles.

**Key examples:**
- Cycle graph → K(ℤ,1) (circle)
- Figure-eight → K(Free(2),1)
- n-cycle → K(ℤ/nℤ,1)

These will be proven in Neural.Homotopy.Examples.
-}

-- Compute π₁ from graph structure
π₁ : DirectedGraph → Type
π₁ G = pi-K G 1

-- A graph G realizes K(π₁(G),1) if it's "good"
-- (Need to define "good" - probably means K(G) is a K(π₁,1) space)
postulate
  IsGoodGraph : DirectedGraph → Type

  good-graph-realizes-K-pi1 :
    (G : DirectedGraph) →
    IsGoodGraph G →
    {!!}  -- K(G) ≃ K(π₁(G), 1)
    -- This would use Delooping! K(π₁(G),1) = Deloop (π₁(G))

## Integration and Realization

Besides homotopy type, graphs also carry **integrated information** Φ.

A **capability specification** includes both:
- Homotopy invariants (π₀, π₁, ...)
- Information integration (Φ)

**Challenge:** Does topology force integration?
- Question: If π₁(G) ≃ Free(n), does this imply Φ(G) ≥ f(n)?
- Conjecture: Non-trivial π₁ requires cycles, cycles enable integration
-}

-- Capability specification
record CapabilitySpec : Type₁ where
  field
    -- Homotopy specification
    target-type : Type

    -- Integration requirement
    Φ-min : ℝ

-- A graph satisfies a capability spec if:
-- 1. It realizes the type
-- 2. It has sufficient integration
SatisfiesSpec : DirectedGraph → CapabilitySpec → Type
SatisfiesSpec G spec =
  Realizes' G (CapabilitySpec.target-type spec)
  ×
  {!!}  -- Φ(G) ≥ spec.Φ-min (need to define Φ comparison)

{-|
## The Synthesis Functor (Desired)

Ideally, we'd have a functor:

  Synthesize : CapabilitySpec → Maybe DirectedGraph

  synthesize-correct :
    (spec : CapabilitySpec) →
    (G : DirectedGraph) →
    Synthesize spec ≡ just G →
    SatisfiesSpec G spec

This is what Phase 2-3 will implement!
-}

postulate
  -- The synthesis function (to be implemented in Synthesis.agda)
  synthesize-from-type : (X : Type) → (Φ-min : ℝ) → Maybe DirectedGraph

  -- Correctness property (to be proven)
  synthesize-correct :
    (X : Type) → (Φ-min : ℝ) →
    (G : DirectedGraph) →
    synthesize-from-type X Φ-min ≡ just G →
    Realizes' G X  -- × (Φ(G) ≥ Φ-min)

{-|
## Examples (Forward Direction)

While synthesis (inverse) is hard, the **forward direction** is easier:
Given a graph, compute its semantic type and invariants.

We can build a library of known realizations:
-}

postulate
  -- Cycle graph realizes the circle S¹
  cycle-graph : DirectedGraph
  cycle-realizes-S¹ : Realizes' cycle-graph {!!}  -- Need S¹ from 1Lab

  -- Empty graph realizes discrete space
  empty-graph : Nat → DirectedGraph
  empty-realizes-discrete :
    (n : Nat) → Realizes' (empty-graph n) {!!}  -- Fin n as discrete space

{-|
## Summary

**What we've formalized:**
1. Semantic functor: semantic : DirectedGraph → PSSet
2. Realization predicate: Realizes' G X
3. Capability specifications (π₁ + Φ)
4. The synthesis problem (inverse)

**Next steps (Phase 2):**
1. Build concrete examples (cycle, figure-eight, etc.)
2. Prove they realize specific K(G,1) spaces
3. Use Delooping to construct target spaces
4. Show graphs realize the deloopings

**Key insight:**
- Delooping: Group → Space (forward, easy)
- Realization: Space → Graph (inverse, hard)
- Strategy: Build examples by hand, then generalize
