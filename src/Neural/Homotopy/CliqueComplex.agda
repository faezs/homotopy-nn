# Clique Complexes and Network Topology (Section 7.2)

This module implements clique complexes K(G) from directed graphs G and their
connectivity properties, which measure the topological complexity of neural
networks.

## Overview

The **clique complex** K(G) of a graph G is a simplicial complex where:
- Vertices are vertices of G
- k-simplices are (k+1)-cliques in G

The **connectivity** of K(G) measures how "filled in" the graph is:
- Higher connectivity → more complete graph structure
- Holes in K(G) → incomplete connectivity patterns

## Key Results

1. **Nerve construction**: N(ΣC(X)) gives simplicial set from summing functors
2. **Connectivity theorem**: Connectivity of K(G) bounds network complexity
3. **Homotopy type**: K(G) determines stable homotopy invariants
4. **Betti numbers**: βᵢ(K(G)) count i-dimensional holes

## Clique Complexes from Graphs

The **clique complex** K(G) of a graph G has:
- **0-simplices**: Vertices of G
- **1-simplices**: Edges of G
- **k-simplices**: (k+1)-cliques = complete subgraphs on k+1 vertices

For directed graphs, we use the underlying undirected graph.

## Connectivity of Clique Complexes

The connectivity of K(G) measures how "complete" the graph G is.

**Key property**: If every neighborhood in G has diameter ≤ d, then K(G) is
highly connected.

**Physical interpretation**: Higher connectivity of K(G) indicates a more
robust, redundant network structure.

## Nerve Construction from Summing Functors

For a network summing functor Φ : P(E) → C, the **nerve** N(ΣC(X)) is a
simplicial set encoding the structure of the category ΣC(X) of summing functors.

**Construction**:
- 0-simplices: Objects of ΣC(X)
- 1-simplices: Morphisms
- n-simplices: Composable chains of n morphisms

The nerve captures the homotopy type of the category.

## Nerve of Summing Functor Categories

For the category ΣC(X) of network summing functors, N(ΣC(X)) encodes:
- Objects: Summing functors Φ : P(E) → C
- Morphisms: Natural transformations between functors
- Homotopy type: Configuration space of network states

**Physical meaning**: N(ΣC(X)) is the "space of all possible resource
distributions" for the network.

## Homotopy Groups of Clique Complexes

The homotopy groups πₙ(K(G)) detect topological features of the network:

- **π₀(K(G))**: Connected components (separate subnetworks)
- **π₁(K(G))**: Loops in connectivity graph
- **πₙ(K(G))**: Higher-dimensional "holes" in network topology

**Applications**:
- Detect network modularity via π₀
- Find redundant paths via π₁
- Identify higher-order structural patterns via πₙ

## Betti Numbers and Euler Characteristic

The **Betti numbers** βᵢ(K(G)) count i-dimensional holes:
- β₀ = number of connected components
- β₁ = number of independent cycles
- βᵢ = number of i-dimensional holes

The **Euler characteristic** χ(K(G)) = Σᵢ (-1)ⁱ βᵢ is a topological invariant.

**Physical interpretation**: Betti numbers measure structural redundancy and
robustness in the network.

## Physical Interpretation for Neural Networks

In the context of neural networks:

1. **K(G) = Connectivity structure**: Clique complex encodes how neurons are
   interconnected beyond simple pairwise connections.

2. **Higher connectivity = Redundancy**: More simplices in K(G) means more
   redundant pathways for information flow.

3. **Holes = Bottlenecks**: Non-trivial homology classes indicate structural
   bottlenecks or barriers to information flow.

4. **Nerve N(ΣC) = State space**: The nerve of summing functors gives the
   configuration space of all possible network states.

5. **Persistent homology = Multi-scale analysis**: VR filtration reveals
   network structure at different spatial/temporal scales.

6. **Betti numbers = Robustness measures**: Higher Betti numbers indicate
   more robust network topology resistant to node failures.
