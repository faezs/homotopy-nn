**Microrotation Phenomenon** (lines 564-620): This is a fascinating result unique to smooth infinitesimal analysis:
- Two neighbouring points don't determine a unique line
- Curvature manifests as microrotation of tangent microsegment
- Rotation amount: bε where b = f''(x₀)
- Fundamentally different from classical limit-based curvature

## 🔑 Key Achievements

### 1. Complete Structural Framework ✅

Every theorem, formula, and exercise from Chapter 3 has:
- Type signature defined
- Page references to Bell (2008)
- Mathematical derivation documented
- Implementation status clearly marked

### 2. Major Derivations Documented ✅

**Cone Volume** (pp. 37-38):
```agda
-- εV'(x) = επb²x²  (from cylindrical slice)
-- Cancel ε: V'(x) = πb²x²
-- Integrate: V(x) = (1/3)πb²x³
```

**Volumes of Revolution** (pp. 40-41):
```agda
-- εV'(x) = volume of frustum
--        = (1/3)πε(f² + f(f+εf') + (f+εf')²)
--        = πεf²  (using ε² = 0)
-- Cancel ε: V'(x) = πf(x)²
```

**Torus** (pp. 41-43):
```agda
-- V'(x) = πf₁² - πf₂²
--       = 4πc√(r² - x²)
--       = 2πc·A'(x)  (where A = circular cross-section area)
-- Integrate: V = 2π²r²c
```

**Arc Length** (pp. 43-44):
```agda
-- PQ·cos φ = ε
-- εs'(x) = PQ = ε/cos φ = ε√(1 + tan²φ) = ε√(1 + f'²)
-- Cancel ε: s'(x) = √(1 + f'(x)²)
```

**Curvature** (pp. 45-46):
```agda
-- From: sin φ = f' cos φ
-- Differentiate: φ' cos φ = f'' cos φ - φ' f'² cos φ
-- Cancel cos φ: φ'(1 + f'²) = f''
-- So: φ' = f''/(1 + f'²)
-- Curvature: κ = φ'/s' = f''/(1 + f'²)^(3/2)
```

### 3. Dependencies Identified ⚠️

**From Functions.agda** (needs implementation):
- `√ : ℝ → ℝ` - Square root function
- `√-deriv : √ ′[x] ≡ 1/(2√x)` - Derivative
- Powers: (1 + f'²)^(3/2) for curvature

**From Base.agda** (already have):
- ✅ Field operations: +ℝ, ·ℝ, /ℝ
- ✅ Δ and ι
- ✅ Microcancellation

**From Calculus.agda** (already have):
- ✅ Derivative notation `_′[_]`
- ✅ Fundamental equation
- ✅ Second derivative `_′′[_]`

### 4. Philosophical Insights ✨

**Microrotation** (pp. 47-48): This section explains WHY curves are curved in smooth infinitesimal analysis:

> "Although in S any two distinct points determine a unique line, two neighbouring
> points do not necessarily do so."

As you move along a curve from P to Q (distance ε ∈ Δ), the tangent microsegment rotates by f''(x₀)·ε. This IS the curvature - not a limit, but the actual infinitesimal rotation!

This provides a **geometric** understanding of curvature that's fundamentally different from the analytical ε-δ approach.

## 🚧 What Needs Implementation

### High Priority

1. **√ function** (Functions.agda)
   - Needed for arc length
   - Needed for surface of revolution
   - Derivation in Bell pp. 51-52

2. **Powers** (Functions.agda)
   - (1 + x)^n for rational n
   - Specifically (1 + x)^(3/2) for curvature

3. **π constant** (Functions.agda)
   - Currently postulated
   - Could define via circle area or integral

### Medium Priority

4. **Archimedes sphere proof**
   - Full moment calculations
   - Trigonometric identities
   - Careful dimensional analysis
   - This is ~100 lines of calculation

5. **Exercise implementations**
   - Frustum volume (similar triangles)
   - Spheroids (apply V'(x) = πf² to ellipse equations)
   - Spherical cap (integrate sphere equation)
   - Paraboloid (apply to y² = 4ax)

6. **Centre/radius of curvature**
   - Coordinate calculations
   - Distance formula
   - Osculating circle equation

### Low Priority

7. **Cavalieri's Principle**
   - Currently postulated as axiom
   - Could formalize as theorem about cross-sectional areas

8. **Division operations**
   - Several formulas need explicit non-zero proofs
   - E.g., cone-volume needs division by 3
   - Curvature needs (1 + f'²) ≠ 0

## 💡 Teaching Value

This module is **pedagogically excellent** because:

1. **Builds on calculus**: Uses fundamental equation from Calculus.agda
2. **Natural progression**: Areas → Volumes → Surfaces → Curvature
3. **Historical methods**: Archimedes, Newton (consecutive normals)
4. **Concrete results**: Sphere volume, torus, arc length - familiar formulas
5. **Deep insight**: Microrotation explains WHAT curvature IS

Perfect for demonstrating that infinitesimal methods aren't just "ε-δ in disguise" - they provide genuine geometric understanding!
