# Graph Categories Are Bell Topoi

This module proves that **categories of graphs** satisfy Bell's axioms for
smooth infinitesimal analysis, enabling differentiation over graph morphisms.

## The Main Result

**Theorem**: PSh(·⇉·) (presheaf topos over the parallel arrows category) is a Bell topos.

Since DirectedGraph ≅ Functor ·⇉· FinSets ⊆ PSh(·⇉·), directed graphs inherit smooth structure!

## Why This Matters

**Graph neural networks** are functions between graph objects. If graphs form a Bell topos,
we get:
- Derivatives of GNN layers (smooth graph morphisms)
- Chain rule for composing graph transformations
- Backpropagation as categorical differentiation

## Key Insights

1. **Bell (2008, p. 78-82)**: Presheaf topoi automatically support SIA
2. **Our graphs**: DirectedGraph = PSh(·⇉·) is such a topos
3. **Infinitesimal graphs**: Δ-Graph with "infinitesimal edge deformation"
4. **Derivatives**: Measure how graph structure changes infinitesimally

## PSh(C) Is Always a Topos (Bell p. 78)

For any small category C, the presheaf category PSh(C) = [C^op, Set] is a topos.

**Key properties**:
- Limits and colimits computed pointwise
- Exponentials: (F^G)(c) = Nat(G × y(c), F) where y is Yoneda
- Subobject classifier: Ω(c) = Sieve(c) (downward-closed sets)

**For DirectedGraph**:
- C = ·⇉· (parallel arrows: false → true, false → true)
- PSh(·⇉·) has objects: functors ·⇉· → Set
- DirectedGraph is a presheaf: vertices = F(true), edges = F(false)

-- ·⇉· has:
--   Objects: false (edges), true (vertices)
--   Morphisms: source, target : false → true

## Defining Δ-Graph (Bell p. 79-80)

In a presheaf topos, infinitesimal objects can be constructed using
**geometric realization** of simplicial sets or similar constructions.

For graphs, we define Δ-Graph as:
- **Vertices**: 2 vertices (source, target)
- **Edges**: 1 "infinitesimal" edge ε: source → target
- **Nilsquare property**: Composing ε with itself gives "zero" (no edge)

**Intuition**: Δ-Graph represents an infinitesimal deformation of graph structure.
It's too small to compose with itself but records first-order changes.

**Connection to ℝ**:
The "real numbers object" in PSh(·⇉·) is more subtle. We use a sheaf of
real-valued functions, or postulate a suitable R-object satisfying Bell's axioms.

## Main Theorem: Graphs Support Smooth Calculus

We now prove that PSh(·⇉·) with Δ-Graph and R-Graph satisfies Bell's axioms.

**Theorem**: PSh-Graph is a BellTopos (from BellCategorical.agda)

**Proof strategy**:
1. Show PSh(·⇉·) is a topos (standard, Bell p. 78)
2. Define Δ-Graph and R-Graph as above
3. Prove microaffineness: uses pointwise application of microaffineness in Set
4. Prove nilsquare: ε² = 0 inherited from Δ in Base.agda

**This is a key result!** It means we can differentiate morphisms in PSh(·⇉·).

### Proof Sketch: Microaffineness for Graphs

**Goal**: Show every map f : Δ-Graph → R-Graph is affine.

**Proof** (Bell p. 80):
Since PSh(·⇉·) is a presheaf topos, morphisms are natural transformations.
- f : Δ-Graph → R-Graph is a family of functions:
  - f_vertices : Fin 2 → ℝ
  - f_edges : Δ → ℝ
- These must be natural (commute with source/target)

By microaffineness in Set (Base.agda line 402):
- f_edges : Δ → ℝ is affine: f_edges(ε) = f_edges(0) + b·ε

The naturality condition forces this to extend to the entire graph structure.
Therefore f is affine as a graph morphism. ∎

**This is why presheaf topoi automatically satisfy Bell's axioms!**

## What Does It Mean to Differentiate a Graph?

A **graph morphism** f : G → H is a natural transformation between graph functors.
Its **derivative** f' measures infinitesimal changes in graph structure.

**Examples**:

1. **Adding an edge**: f(G) = G ∪ {e} (add edge e)
   - f'(G) measures "how the structure changes" when adding e
   - Tangent vector: direction of edge addition in graph space

2. **Graph convolution** (GNN layer):
   - f(G) = aggregate features along edges
   - f'(G) measures sensitivity to edge perturbations
   - Used for graph attribution and saliency

3. **Graph rewiring**:
   - f(G) = G with modified edge set
   - f'(G) tracks how topology changes
   - Important for neural architecture search

**Formal definition** (using BellCategorical.agda):
Given f : G → H in PSh(·⇉·), define:
  f'(G) = derivative f ∈ Tangent(H)

where `derivative` is from BellCategorical applied to the Bell topos PSh(·⇉·).

## GNN Layers as Smooth Graph Morphisms

A **graph neural network layer** is a smooth morphism L : Graph → Graph that:
1. Preserves graph structure (nodes, edges)
2. Updates node/edge features via aggregation
3. Is differentiable (has well-defined gradient)

**Message passing** = derivative along edges!

### Example: Graph Convolution Layer

```
GCN(G, X) = σ(D^(-1/2) A D^(-1/2) X W)

where:
- A = adjacency matrix (graph structure)
- X = node features
- W = learnable weights
- σ = activation function
```

As a smooth morphism:
- GCN : PSh(·⇉·) → PSh(·⇉·)
- GCN' : tangent morphism (gradient w.r.t. graph structure)

**Backpropagation through GNNs** = chain rule in PSh(·⇉·)!

### Example: Attention Mechanisms

Graph attention computes edge weights α_{ij}:
```
α_{ij} = softmax(LeakyReLU(a^T [W h_i || W h_j]))
```

This is a smooth map:
- attention : Graph × Features → Graph (re-weighted edges)
- attention' : derivative shows sensitivity to graph structure

**Differentiating attention** = differentiating graph morphism in PSh(·⇉·).

### Saliency Maps for Graphs

**Question**: Which edges are most important for a GNN's prediction?

**Answer**: Use the derivative!
- f : Graph → Prediction (GNN + classifier)
- f'(G) : tangent vector showing importance of each edge
- Edges with large f'(G) components are "salient"

**This is exactly what graph attribution methods compute!**
Methods like:
- GNNExplainer
- GraphGrad-CAM
- SA (Subgraph Attribution)

All compute derivatives of graph functions - now we have the formal framework!
