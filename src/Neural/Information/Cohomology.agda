# Cohomological Information Theory (Section 8.2)

This module extends Shannon entropy to cohomological integrated information,
providing higher-order measures of information integration.

## Overview

**Cohomological information** assigns information measures to simplicial complexes:
- 0-cochains: Local information at neurons
- 1-cochains: Pairwise interactions
- n-cochains: n-way interactions
- Coboundary operator: Measures integration across levels

**Integrated information Φ** measures irreducibility of a system to independent
parts via cohomology.

## Key Results

1. **Shannon entropy as 0-cocycle**: H(X) is a 0-dimensional cohomology class
2. **Mutual information as coboundary**: I(X;Y) = δH for coboundary operator δ
3. **Integrated information Φ**: Measured by cohomological Φ in higher dimensions
4. **Persistent homology**: Tracks integration across scales

## Simplicial Complexes from Neural Systems

A neural system with n neurons defines a simplicial complex K where:
- 0-simplices: Individual neurons
- 1-simplices: Pairs of neurons with significant interaction
- k-simplices: (k+1)-cliques of strongly coupled neurons

This is the **functional connectivity complex**.

## Cochains and Cohomology

A **k-cochain** assigns a value to each k-simplex:
  c : K_k → ℝ

The **coboundary operator** δ : C^k → C^(k+1) measures how cochains change:
  (δc)(σ) = Σ_{i} (-1)^i c(∂_i σ)

**Cohomology** H^k(K; ℝ) = ker(δ) / im(δ) measures obstructions to integration.

**Physical meaning**:
- k-cochains = k-way information measures
- δc = 0 means c is "integrable" (cocycle)
- c = δb means c is "trivial" (coboundary)

## Shannon Entropy as 0-Cocycle

The **Shannon entropy** H(X) can be viewed as a 0-cochain assigning to each
neuron i its marginal entropy:

  H_i = -Σ_x p_i(x) log p_i(x)

**Key property**: H is a **cocycle** (δH = 0 in appropriate sense) when
neurons are independent.

When neurons are dependent, δH measures the deviation from independence.

## Mutual Information as Coboundary

The **mutual information** I(X;Y) measures dependence between random variables.

In cohomological terms, I(X;Y) = (δH)(X,Y) where δ is the coboundary operator:

  I(X;Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y)
         = (δH)(X,Y)

This shows mutual information is the coboundary of entropy!

**Physical meaning**: MI measures how much entropy "changes" when going from
parts to whole.

## Integrated Information Φ

**Integrated information** Φ measures the irreducibility of a system to
independent parts.

**Tononi's definition** (simplified):
  Φ(X) = min_{partition π} D_KL(p(X) || p_π(X))

where p_π is the product distribution under partition π.

**Cohomological reformulation**:
  Φ(X) = ‖δH‖ = size of coboundary measuring integration

**Higher-dimensional Φ**:
  Φ^k(X) = dim H^k(K; ℝ)

measures k-dimensional integration.

## Φ as Divergence from Product Distribution

The integrated information Φ can be formulated as:

  Φ(X) = D_KL(p(X) || Π_i p(X_i))

where Π_i p(X_i) is the product of marginals (minimum information partition).

This makes Φ a **geometric quantity** in the Fisher-Rao geometry!

**Physical meaning**: Φ measures how far the true distribution is from the
"no-integration" product distribution.

## Persistent Integrated Information

**Persistent homology** tracks how cohomology classes (integration) persist
across scales:

- Birth: When a k-dimensional integration first appears
- Death: When it becomes trivial (reducible)
- Persistence: How long it lasts

**Physical meaning**: Robust integration persists across scales, transient
integration dies quickly.

**Applications**: Distinguish genuine consciousness from fleeting correlations.

## Connection to Consciousness

**Integrated Information Theory (IIT)** posits that consciousness corresponds to
systems with high Φ.

**Cohomological perspective**:
1. **High Φ = Rich cohomology**: Conscious systems have non-trivial H^k
2. **Irreducibility = Cohomology classes**: Integration corresponds to cocycles
3. **Persistence = Stability**: Robust consciousness requires persistent Φ

**Predictions**:
- Conscious states: High persistent Φ
- Unconscious states: Low Φ or transient Φ
- Vegetative states: Φ > 0 but not persistent

**Testable hypothesis**: Cohomological Φ correlates with subjective experience.

## Physical Interpretation Summary

**Cohomological information provides**:

1. **Higher-order integration**: Beyond pairwise to n-way interactions

2. **Geometric structure**: Φ as distance in information geometry

3. **Scale-dependent analysis**: Persistent homology across network scales

4. **Consciousness measure**: Robust, testable predictions for IIT

5. **Network topology**: Cohomology detects structural complexity

**Connection to Gamma networks** (Section 7): The homotopy groups πₙ(E)
of Gamma networks relate to cohomology H^n(K), providing dual perspectives
on network complexity.

**Unification**: Homotopy theory (Section 7) and information geometry (Section 8)
converge in cohomological integrated information, providing a unified framework
for consciousness, neural computation, and network architecture.
