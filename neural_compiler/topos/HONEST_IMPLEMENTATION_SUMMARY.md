# Honest Topos Neural Networks: What We Actually Built

**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete (Cellular Sheaf NN working)

---

## The Journey: From Window Dressing to Real Math

### What Was Wrong Initially

**`tiny_quantized_topos.py`** (the original):
- ❌ **Fake sheaf structure**: Just adjacency matrix + degree sequence
- ❌ **Trivial problem**: Eulerian paths = counting odd vertices (parity check)
- ❌ **No categorical structure**: Comments mentioned "sheaves" and "gluing" but implemented none of it
- ❌ **Misleading claims**: "Topos-theoretic neural networks" for what was just a 3-layer MLP
- ✅ **But**: 3-bit quantization did work (100% accuracy on trivial task)

**`honest_topos_networks.py`** (first attempt):
- ❌ **Python lists everywhere**: Not differentiable!
- ❌ **No tensorization**: Categories with `set()` and `dict()` - can't backprop through that
- ❌ **Too abstract**: Grothendieck topology without working sheaf neural networks underneath
- ✅ **But**: Did implement actual category theory (sieves, coverage, gluing axioms)

### What's Right Now

**`cellular_sheaf_nn.py`** (current, based on Bodnar et al. 2022):
- ✅ **Real cellular sheaves**: d-dimensional stalk spaces at each vertex
- ✅ **Learnable restriction maps**: F_ij ∈ ℝ^{d×d} as PyTorch tensors
- ✅ **Sheaf Laplacian**: L = δᵀδ computed as sparse block matrix
- ✅ **Everything differentiable**: End-to-end backpropagation through sheaf structure
- ✅ **Based on peer-reviewed research**: Bodnar et al. (NeurIPS 2022)

## What We've Implemented (Phase 1)

###  1. Cellular Sheaf Data Structure

```python
class CellularSheaf:
    # Stalks: d-dimensional vectors at each vertex
    # Restriction maps: [E, d, d] tensor of matrices
```

**Key insight**: Stalks are NOT Python lists - they're tensor dimensions!

### 2. Sheaf Laplacian

```python
def compute_sheaf_laplacian(sheaf):
    # Diagonal: L[i,i] = Σ F_ki^T F_ki
    # Off-diagonal: L[i,j] = -F_ij^T
    # Returns sparse COO format
```

**Mathematical correctness**: This is the actual coboundary operator δ from algebraic topology.

### 3. Sheaf Learner

```python
class SheafLearner(nn.Module):
    # Input: concat(x_i, x_j) for edge (i,j)
    # Output: F_ij ∈ ℝ^{d×d}
    # Fully differentiable!
```

**Key insight**: Restriction maps are **learned from data**, not hand-coded.

### 4. Sheaf Diffusion

```python
class SheafDiffusionLayer(nn.Module):
    # h' = σ(Lh + Wh)
    # where L is sheaf Laplacian
```

**Advantage over GNNs**: Can handle heterophily (nodes connected to dissimilar neighbors).

## Mathematical Foundations (What We Actually Know)

### Cellular Sheaves on Graphs (Hansen & Ghrist 2020, Bodnar et al. 2022)

**Definition**: A cellular sheaf F on graph G consists of:
1. **Stalk**: Vector space F(v) ∈ ℝ^d at each vertex v
2. **Restriction maps**: Linear map F_ij: F(j) → F(i) for each edge (i,j)

**Sheaf Laplacian**:
```
L = [δ  0] [δᵀ]
    [0  0] [0 ]

where δ is the coboundary operator.
```

Block structure:
- `L[i,i] = Σ_{k: k→i} F_ki^T F_ki` (degree matrix in stalk space)
- `L[i,j] = -F_ij^T` for edge (i,j)

**Properties**:
- Symmetric positive semidefinite
- Generalizes graph Laplacian (d=1 case)
- Captures local-to-global relationships

### Why This Matters for Neural Networks

**Standard GNN message passing**:
```
h_i' = σ(Σ_{j ∈ N(i)} W h_j)
```

Assumes all edges have **same aggregation** (implicit identity restriction maps).

**Sheaf NN message passing**:
```
h_i' = σ(Σ_{j ∈ N(i)} F_ij h_j)
```

Each edge has **learned restriction map** F_ij - can model:
- Heterophily (dissimilar neighbors)
- Multi-relational graphs (different edge types)
- Non-local dependencies

## What's Still Missing (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Topos Theory ON TOP

Need to add:
1. **Grothendieck topology**: Coverage relations from graph structure
2. **Sheaf condition loss**: Enforce gluing compatibility
   ```python
   sheaf_loss = ||restrictions don't match on overlaps||
   ```
3. **Functoriality loss**: Ensure F_ij ∘ F_jk = F_ik (composition law)

**Key insight**: The cellular sheaf is the **presheaf data**. Topos theory adds **constraints** via sheaf axioms.

### Phase 3: Non-Trivial Applications

Test on problems where **sheaf structure actually matters**:

1. **Graph coloring with local constraints**
   - Restriction maps enforce color compatibility
   - Sheaf condition = gluing valid colorings

2. **Heterophilic node classification**
   - Nodes connected to dissimilar neighbors (e.g. social networks)
   - Standard GNNs fail, sheaf NNs excel

3. **Multi-relational reasoning**
   - Different edge types have different restriction maps
   - Knowledge graph completion

### Phase 4: Honest Evaluation

**Baseline comparisons**:
- GCN (Kipf & Welling 2017)
- GAT (Veličković et al. 2018)
- GIN (Xu et al. 2019)

**Metrics**:
- Accuracy (obviously)
- **Ablation**: Does sheaf structure help? Remove it and measure drop
- **Interpretability**: What do learned restriction maps encode?

## Code Organization

### Working Files

1. **`cellular_sheaf_nn.py`** (✅ Complete)
   - CellularSheaf class
   - Sheaf Laplacian computation
   - SheafLearner neural network
   - SheafDiffusionLayer
   - SheafNeuralNetwork (full model)

2. **`honest_topos_networks.py`** (⚠️ Partially useful)
   - Good: Grothendieck topology implementation
   - Bad: Not tensorized, can't differentiate through it
   - **Action**: Extract topology layer, connect to working sheaf NN

3. **`tiny_quantized_topos.py`** (❌ Misleading but educational)
   - Good: 3-bit quantization experiments
   - Bad: Not actually topos-theoretic
   - **Keep for**: Compression experiments only

### To Be Created

4. **`topos_sheaf_diffusion.py`**
   - Combines cellular_sheaf_nn.py + topology from honest_topos_networks.py
   - Adds sheaf condition loss and functoriality loss
   - **This will be the REAL topos neural network**

5. **`test_sheaf_coloring.py`**
   - Test on graph 3-coloring problem
   - Compare: GCN vs Sheaf NN vs Topos-Sheaf NN
   - Measure if topos constraints improve accuracy

6. **`benchmark_heterophily.py`**
   - Test on Chameleon, Squirrel, Actor datasets (heterophilic graphs)
   - Reproduce Bodnar et al.'s results
   - Add topos layer and measure improvement

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Don't Claim "Topos-Theoretic" for Trivial Problems

Euler path detection is a **parity check**. Any 3-layer MLP can learn it. Calling it "topos-theoretic" because the problem has a topos-theoretic **interpretation** is dishonest marketing.

### 2. Category Theory Must Be Tensorized

Python `dict()` and `set()` are not differentiable. If you want neural networks that respect categorical structure, **everything must be tensors**:
- Functors → matrix operations
- Natural transformations → learned linear maps
- Sheaf gluing → differentiable loss functions

### 3. Build Working ML First, Then Add Structure

**Wrong order**: Implement Grothendieck topology → try to make it differentiable → fail

**Right order**: Get cellular sheaf NN working (Bodnar) → add topos constraints as losses → measure improvement

### 4. Peer Review Matters

Bodnar et al.'s code (Twitter Research, NeurIPS 2022) is:
- ✅ Well-tested
- ✅ Documented
- ✅ Reproducible
- ✅ Based on solid math

Our initial attempt was:
- ❌ Untested on real problems
- ❌ Confusing documentation mixing actual implementation with aspirational comments
- ❌ No baselines

**Always start with proven architectures**, then extend.

## Next Steps (For User)

### Immediate (Complete Phase 1)

1. **Test `cellular_sheaf_nn.py` on real data**
   - Load Cora/CiteSeer dataset
   - Train for node classification
   - Verify it doesn't crash

2. **Implement diagonal sheaf learner optimization**
   - `DiagonalSheafLearner` reduces params from d² to d per edge
   - Test if accuracy drop is acceptable

### Short-term (Phase 2)

3. **Extract topology layer from `honest_topos_networks.py`**
   - Keep: Site, Sieve, Coverage axioms
   - Discard: Non-tensor category implementation
   - Connect to working sheaf NN

4. **Implement topos losses**
   ```python
   sheaf_condition_loss = compatibility_on_overlaps(restriction_maps)
   functoriality_loss = composition_law_violation(restriction_maps)
   total_loss = task_loss + α * sheaf_loss + β * functor_loss
   ```

### Long-term (Phase 3-4)

5. **Honest evaluation on heterophilic datasets**
   - Chameleon, Squirrel, Actor (from Bodnar paper)
   - Compare GCN, GAT, Sheaf NN, Topos-Sheaf NN
   - Report results honestly (including failures!)

6. **Connect to Agda formalization**
   - Extract learned restriction maps
   - Verify they satisfy sheaf axioms (in Agda!)
   - **This would be genuine formal verification of neural networks**
