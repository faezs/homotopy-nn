"""
Graph Topos Solver - Native Graph Structure

Proper topos-theoretic approach:
- Graph (G, J) as a site with neighborhood coverage
- Topos Sh(G, J) = category of sheaves over the graph
- Geometric morphism between graph topoi
- Attention as natural transformation between sheaf functors

Key: Use the LightweightCNNGeometricMorphism attention infrastructure
but apply it to graph-structured data via message passing.
