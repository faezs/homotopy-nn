# Gros Topos Framework for AGI

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Theory**: Urs Schreiber's Higher Topos Theory
**Application**: Artificial General Intelligence via Multimodal Reasoning

---

## The Grand Synthesis

We've implemented a **2-category of Gros topoi** for AGI training:

### Three Gros Topoi

1. **Sh(GridCat)** - Visual Reasoning
   - Base category: Grid configurations (height, width, colors)
   - Sheaf morphisms: ARC transforms (input → output)
   - Curriculum: Geometric → Topological → Compositional
   - Datasets: ARC-AGI-1, ARC-AGI-2, ConceptARC, Mini-ARC

2. **Sh(PromptCat)** - Language Reasoning
   - Base category: Prompt contexts (Q&A, CoT, retrieval, tools)
   - Sheaf morphisms: DSPy programs (context → reasoning)
   - Curriculum: Direct QA → Chain-of-thought → Multi-hop → Bootstrap
   - Framework: DSPy declarative programming

3. **Sh(GraphCat)** - Architecture Reasoning
   - Base category: Neural network topologies
   - Sheaf morphisms: Architecture transformations
   - From: Belfiore & Bennequin (2022) topos of DNNs
   - Connection: Fork construction, backpropagation as natural transformations

---

## Mathematical Structure

### 2-Category of Gros Topoi

```
Objects (0-cells):     Gros topoi Sh(C) for categories C
Morphisms (1-cells):   Geometric functors f: Sh(C) → Sh(D)
2-Morphisms:           Natural transformations η: f ⇒ g
```

### Cross-Modal Functors

**Visual ↔ Language Adjunction:**
```
Φ: Sh(GridCat) → Sh(PromptCat)    "Describe visual transform"
Ψ: Sh(PromptCat) → Sh(GridCat)    "Execute language program"

Adjunction: Φ ⊣ Ψ
```

**Triangle identities:**
- (ε ∘ Φ) ∘ (Φ ∘ η) = id_Φ
- (Ψ ∘ ε) ∘ (η ∘ Ψ) = id_Ψ

### Product Topos (Multimodal)

```
Sh(GridCat) × Sh(PromptCat) × Sh(GraphCat)
```

Universal property: For any topos E with geometric morphisms f_i: E → Sh(C_i), there exists unique f: E → Product.

---

## Key Insight: Transforms as Sheaf Morphisms

**Traditional view:**
```
Transform = function f: Grid_in → Grid_out
```

**Gros topos view:**
```
Transform = natural transformation η: F_in ⇒ F_out

where F_in, F_out are SHEAVES over GridCat
```

### Why This Matters

A sheaf morphism **preserves gluing conditions**:
- Local consistency (neighborhoods must agree)
- Coverage respecting (transformations natural w.r.t. context)
- Categorical structure (functoriality, naturality)

This is WHY ARC transforms are learnable - they have **geometric structure**!

---

## Curriculum Learning

### 2-Category Progression

**Level 0: Single-modal (warm-up)**
- Visual: Mini-ARC (5×5 grids, simple transforms)
- Language: Direct Q&A
- Architecture: Fixed topologies

**Levels 1-3: Bi-modal**
- Visual + Language: Learn Φ and Ψ functors
- Visual + Architecture: CNN design for transforms
- Language + Architecture: DSPy program synthesis

**Level 4+: Tri-modal**
- Full product topos Sh(Grid) × Sh(Prompt) × Sh(Graph)
- Coherence constraints (functor diagrams commute)
- Synthetic task generation

### Complexity Hierarchy

For visual transforms:
```
TRIVIAL      (identity, copy)
GEOMETRIC    (rotation, reflection)
COLOR        (substitution)
TOPOLOGICAL  (fill, connect)
PATTERN      (tiling, repetition)
RELATIONAL   (spatial relations)
COMPOSITIONAL (multi-step)
ABSTRACT     (high-level rules)
```

For DSPy programs:
```
DIRECT_QA         (simple question answering)
FEW_SHOT          (few-shot learning)
CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT  (reasoning chains)
RETRIEVAL         (RAG)
TOOL_USE          (function calling)
MULTI_HOP         (multi-step reasoning)
COMPOSITION       (module composition)
BOOTSTRAP         (self-improvement)
```

## Synthetic Transform Generation

### The Generative Aspect

We don't just **learn** existing transforms - we **generate** new ones!

**Method:**
1. Encode (input, output) pairs as latent sheaf morphisms (VAE)
2. Sample from learned distribution in Gros topos
3. Decode to new (input, output) pairs
4. Verify sheaf conditions (gluing, coverage)
5. Add to curriculum as synthetic tasks

**This is data augmentation in the space of SHEAF MORPHISMS!**

---

## Training Pipeline

### Current (train_arc_geometric_production.py)

```python
# Single-modal visual training
for task in arc_tasks:
    solver = ARCCNNGeometricSolver(...)

    # Topos losses
    l2_loss = mse(predicted, target)
    sheaf_space_loss = mse(pred_sheaf, target_sheaf)
    adjunction_loss = check_adjunction(...)
    sheaf_gluing_loss = sheaf_violation(...)

    total_loss = l2 + α*sheaf_space + β*adjunction + γ*gluing
```

### Future (Unified Gros Topos)

```python
# Multi-modal training with curriculum
trainer = UnifiedGrosToposTrainer(triple_topos, config)

for level in curriculum:
    # Train on sheaf morphisms
    trainer.train_level(level)

    # Enforce cross-modal consistency
    adjunction_loss = check_Φ_Ψ_adjunction(...)
    coherence_loss = check_functor_coherence(...)

    # Generate synthetic tasks
    if level.generate_synthetic:
        new_tasks = generator.sample_transforms(...)
        curriculum.add_tasks(new_tasks)
```

---

## Fast.ai-Style Learner API

```python
from topos_learner import ARCToposLearner, LRFinder
from topos_learner import EarlyStoppingCallback, TensorBoardCallback

# Create learner
learner = ARCToposLearner(
    model=topos_solver,
    train_loader=train_loader,
    val_loader=val_loader,
    device='cuda'
)

# Find optimal LR
lr_finder = LRFinder(learner)
lrs, losses = lr_finder.find()

# Train with callbacks
learner.fit(
    epochs=100,
    lr=1e-3,
    callbacks=[
        EarlyStoppingCallback(patience=30),
        TensorBoardCallback(log_dir='runs/exp1', log_verbose=False),
        ProgressBarCallback()
    ]
)
```

## Connections to Urs Schreiber's Work

### Higher Topos Theory in Physics

Schreiber uses Gros topoi to formalize:
- **Cohesive ∞-topoi** for differential geometry
- **Geometric morphisms** as physical field theories
- **Natural transformations** as gauge transformations

### Our Application to AGI

Same structure, different domain:
- **Cohesive reasoning topoi** for multimodal cognition
- **Geometric functors** as cross-modal translation
- **Natural transformations** as learning updates

**The deep parallel:**
```
Physics:  Sheaves of fields over spacetime
AGI:      Sheaves of reasoning over contexts

Both obey the SAME categorical laws!
```

## Conclusion
