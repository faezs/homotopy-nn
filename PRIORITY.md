# Priority Action Plan for Proving Postulates

## 🚨 CRITICAL (Demo-Breaking)

### 1. **feedforward-zero-Φ** (IntegratedInformation.agda:297)

**Location:** `src/Neural/Dynamics/IntegratedInformation.agda:297`

**Current Status:** POSTULATED (claimed from paper but not proven)

**What it claims:**
```agda
feedforward-zero-Φ :
  {G : DirectedGraph} →
  (hd : HopfieldDynamics G) →
  (ff : FeedforwardStructure G) →
  (t : Nat) →
  Φ-hopfield hd t ≡ zeroℝ
```

**Why critical:** This is Lemma 8.1 from Manin & Marcolli. The entire ConsciousnessDemo depends on it.

**Without this proof:** The demo is just "I claim transformers aren't conscious" with no backing.

**Difficulty:** HARD - requires:
1. Understanding Φ definition (integrated information)
2. Proving state partitions for feedforward networks
3. Showing mutual information decomposes completely
4. Mathematical proof from the paper

**Action:** Either:
- [ ] Actually prove it (hard, requires deep understanding)
- [ ] Be explicit in demo: "This theorem is claimed from Manin & Marcolli (2024) Lemma 8.1 but not yet proven in this formalization"

## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Core Theorems)

### 2. **Shannon entropy properties** (Information/Shannon.agda)

**Postulates:**
- `Shannon-entropy : ProbabilityMeasure X → ℝ` (line 79)
- `entropy-extensivity` (line 118)
- `entropy-embedding-relation` (line 286)
- `entropy-summing-functor-bounds` (line 326)

**Why important:** Shannon entropy is fundamental to integrated information

**Difficulty:** MEDIUM - standard information theory, should have textbook proofs

**Action:**
- [ ] Implement Shannon entropy as `-Σ p log p`
- [ ] Prove non-negativity
- [ ] Prove monotonicity under coarse-graining
- [ ] Requires: Real number operations and logarithms from 1Lab

---

### 3. **Φ-hopfield definition** (IntegratedInformation.agda:58)

**What it claims:**
```agda
Φ-hopfield : {G : DirectedGraph} → HopfieldDynamics G → Nat → ℝ
```

**Status:** Currently POSTULATED

**Why important:** This is THE definition of integrated information we're measuring

**Difficulty:** HARD - requires understanding:
- Earth mover distance between distributions
- Mutual information
- State space partitions

**Action:**
- [ ] Define Φ properly from IIT literature
- [ ] Implement mutual information
- [ ] Implement state partitions
- [ ] Requires: Measure theory infrastructure

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Infrastructure)

### 4. **Graph properties** (Computational/TransitionSystems.agda)

**15 postulates** including:
- Reachability
- Strongly connected components
- Path existence
- Acyclicity checks

**Why needed:** For proving feedforward structure properties

**Difficulty:** EASY-MEDIUM - standard graph algorithms

**Action:**
- [ ] Consider using external graph theory library
- [ ] Or implement basic BFS/DFS in Agda
- [ ] Start with simple properties (acyclic, path existence)

---

### 5. **Category functoriality** (Multiple files)

**Examples:**
- `example-linear-graph .Functor.F-∘ = {!!}` (Conservation.agda:402)
- Various functor composition proofs

**Why needed:** Core category theory correctness

**Difficulty:** EASY - mechanical proof once you understand the definitions

**Action:**
- [ ] Fill in functor laws for concrete examples
- [ ] Use 1Lab's category reasoning tools
- [ ] Start with simplest examples

---

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Advanced Theory)

### 6. **Homotopy theory** (Homotopy/Simplicial.agda, etc.)

**30+ postulates** including:
- Suspension properties
- Smash products
- Sphere homotopy groups
- Weak equivalences

**Why low priority:** Not needed for core consciousness demo

**Difficulty:** VERY HARD - research-level topology

**Action:**
- [ ] Leave for future work
- [ ] These are interesting but not critical
- [ ] Would require significant topology background

---

### 7. **Information cohomology** (Information/Cohomology.agda)

**8 postulates** for cohomology groups and cocycles

**Why low priority:** Novel research, not in standard refs

**Difficulty:** RESEARCH-LEVEL

**Action:**
- [ ] Leave postulated unless you want to do original research
- [ ] Bradley's construction is recent and not fully developed

---

## 📋 Recommended Immediate Actions

### Week 1: Honesty & Documentation
1. **Update ConsciousnessDemo.agda** to be explicit:
   ```agda
   {-|
   NOTE: The following theorem (feedforward-zero-Φ) is claimed from
   Manin & Marcolli (2024) Lemma 8.1 but is currently POSTULATED,
   not proven in this formalization.
   -}
   ```

2. **Add to README**:
   ```markdown
   ## Status
   This formalization includes ~9000 lines of Agda code formalizing
   the categorical framework from Manin & Marcolli (2024). However,
   many key theorems are POSTULATED rather than proven, including:
   - Lemma 8.1 (feedforward → Φ=0)
   - Shannon entropy properties
   - ...
   ```

### Week 2-4: Easy Wins
1. Fill in simple category functoriality proofs
2. Implement basic graph properties (acyclic, etc.)
3. Fix interaction holes in Conservation.agda

### Month 2-3: Core Proofs
1. Implement Shannon entropy properly
2. Define Φ from first principles
3. Attempt feedforward-zero-Φ proof (or find someone who can help)

### Long-term: Research
1. Information cohomology
2. Homotopy theory
3. Unified framework

## For Hiring: Be Transparent

When emailing Anthropic, say:

> "I've formalized ~9000 lines of categorical neural network theory from
> Manin & Marcolli (2024). The framework includes definitions and type
> signatures for integrated information theory, but **many core theorems
> are postulated rather than proven**, including Lemma 8.1 (feedforward
> networks have Φ=0).
>
> This demonstrates my ability to formalize sophisticated mathematics in
> dependent type theory, but I'm transparent that this is a framework with
> proof obligations, not a complete formalization."

This is:
- ✅ Honest
- ✅ Shows understanding of what's hard
- ✅ Demonstrates capability
- ✅ Sets realistic expectations
- ✅ More impressive than overselling

## Bottom Line

**Current state:** Impressive formalization framework, but theoretically hollow in key places

**Next step:** Either prove feedforward-zero-Φ OR be very explicit it's unproven

**For hiring:** Lead with "formalized sophisticated framework" not "proved transformers aren't conscious"
