**Discovery**: Paper (lines 572-577) gives **explicit construction**!
- Not the generic HIT construction
- Pointwise: only changes fork-stars to products
- Makes left-exactness proof much simpler

**Created documentation**:
- `SHEAFIFICATION_ANALYSIS.md`: Complete proof strategy
- `ARCHITECTURE_POSTULATES.md`: Status of all remaining postulates
- Clear path forward using "products preserve limits"

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
