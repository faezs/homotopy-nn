## 🎯 This Session's Specific Achievements (October 16, 2025 - Part 2)

### 1. Deep Investigation of Sheafification Left-Exactness
**Challenge**: Prove `fork-sheafification-lex : is-lex Sheafification` without postulates

**Findings**:
- ❌ **Adjunction-based approach doesn't work**: Attempted to transport contractibility through `Sheafification ⊣ forget-sheaf`, but unit is not generally an isomorphism
- ❌ **Right adjoint lemma inapplicable**: `right-adjoint→terminal` applies to right adjoints (preserve limits), but Sheafification is LEFT adjoint (preserves colimits)
- ❌ **Reflective properties insufficient**: Counit isomorphism doesn't give us what we need for terminal preservation

**Key Discovery**: Even 1Lab (~10MB of formalized category theory) does NOT have a proof that sheafification is left-exact. This is a genuinely deep result.

**Documentation Created**:
- ✅ `SHEAFIFICATION_LEX_PROOF_ATTEMPT.md`: Comprehensive 300-line analysis
  - Documents all three attempted approaches
  - Explains why each approach failed
  - Provides detailed roadmap for Option B (explicit construction)
  - Estimates 300-500 lines, 8-16 hours for full proof
- ✅ Updated `SHEAFIFICATION_LEX_ANALYSIS.md` with new findings
- ✅ Updated Architecture.agda with detailed comments explaining challenge

### 2. Identified Path Forward (Option B)
**Approach**: Use paper's explicit fork construction (ToposOfDNNs.agda lines 572-579)

**Key Insight from Paper**:
> "The sheafification process... is easy to describe: no value is changed except at a place A★, where X_A★ is replaced by the product X★_A★ of the X_a'"

**Proof Strategy**:
```
Terminal Preservation:
  Sheafify(T)(A★) = ∏_{a'→A★} T(a')
                  = ∏_{a'→A★} singleton
                  ≅ singleton              (products of contractibles!)
  ∴ Sheafify(T) is terminal ✓

Pullback Preservation:
  Sheafify(P)(A★) = ∏_{a'→A★} (X(a') ×_Y Z(a'))
                  = (∏ X(a')) ×_{∏ Y(a')} (∏ Z(a'))  (products preserve pullbacks!)
                  = Sheafify(X)(A★) ×_... Sheafify(Z)(A★)
  ∴ Sheafified diagram is pullback ✓
```

**Required Infrastructure** (not in 1Lab):
1. `Π-is-contr`: Products of contractibles are contractible
2. `fork-sheafification-explicit`: Explicit construction equals HIT 🔥 **HARDEST**
3. `Π-preserves-pullbacks`: Products preserve pullbacks

**Status**: 🔴 **BLOCKED** - Requires 1-2 days of focused work on HIT reasoning

**After session**: 2 holes (with explicit construction from paper)

**Major proof**: `fork-star-tine-stability`
- Proved constructively that any path to fork-star A★ contains a tine

- Used path induction + downward closure of tines
- **Eliminated 1 postulate!**

### 2. Analyzed Sheafification for Fork Topology

- Not the generic HIT construction
- Pointwise: only changes fork-stars to products
- Makes left-exactness proof much simpler

**Created documentation**:
- `SHEAFIFICATION_ANALYSIS.md`: Complete proof strategy
- `ARCHITECTURE_POSTULATES.md`: Status of all remaining postulates
- Clear path forward using "products preserve limits"

### 3. Code Quality Improvements
- Split `is-lex` into `pres-⊤` and `pres-pullback` with detailed comments
- Added proof strategies as inline documentation
- Used agda-mcp iteratively to verify compilation
- Maintained type-correctness throughout refactoring
