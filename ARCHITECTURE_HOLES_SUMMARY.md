# Architecture.agda Holes Summary

**File**: `/Users/faezs/homotopy-nn/src/Neural/Topos/Architecture.agda`
**Total holes**: 13
**Status**: All documented with clear implementation strategies

## Category: Sheafification (2 holes) - ACTIVE WORK

These are the main mathematical proofs needed to complete the topos theory.

### Hole 1: Line 678 - Terminal preservation
**Type**: `is-contr (F => T-sheafified-underlying)`
**Context**: Proving sheafification preserves terminal objects

```agda
morphism-space-contractible : is-contr (F => T-sheafified-underlying)
morphism-space-contractible = {!!}
```

**Strategy** (from comments):
1. Use counit: `forget (Sheafification T) → T` (iso for reflective subcategory)
2. Since `T-sheafified-underlying ≅ T` and `F → T` is contractible
3. Compose to get `F → T-sheafified-underlying` is contractible

**Dependencies**: Reflective subcategory theory, adjunction counit

---

### Hole 2: Line 684 - Pullback preservation
**Type**: `is-pullback Sh[...] (Sheafification.F₁ p1) ...`
**Context**: Proving sheafification preserves pullbacks (makes it left-exact)

```agda
fork-sheafification-lex .is-lex.pres-pullback pb-psh = {!!}
```

**Strategy** (from comments):
1. Pullback in presheaves computed pointwise: `P(x) = X(x) ×_{Y(x)} Z(x)`
2. At fork-star after sheafification: `P_sheaf(A★) = ∏_{a'→A★} P(a')`
3. Show products commute with pullbacks

**Dependencies**: Pointwise limits in presheaves, explicit sheafification construction from paper

**Reference**: Paper lines 572-579 describe explicit sheafification at fork-stars

## Category: Backpropagation Manifolds (11 holes) - DEFERRED

### Hole 8: Line 848 - Tangent space (weights)

**Paper reference**: Lemma 1.1, full backprop formula
**Connection**: This should be Bell's categorical derivative (chain rule) once manifolds defined

---

### Hole 11: Line 882 - Weight presheaf
**Type**: `Functor (Fork-Category ^op) (Sets (o ⊔ ℓ))`
**Purpose**: Presheaf representing weight spaces at each layer

**Connection**: **THIS IS WHERE BELL'S CATEGORICAL DERIVATIVE CONNECTS!**

---

## Implementation Priority

### HIGH PRIORITY (Currently blocking)
1. **Hole 1** (line 678): Terminal preservation - needed for `is-lex` proof
2. **Hole 2** (line 684): Pullback preservation - needed for `is-lex` proof

Both use standard topos theory. Clear strategies documented.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Deferred - requires smooth manifolds)
3-12. Manifold-based backpropagation infrastructure

Requires:
- Smooth manifold module for `ActivityManifold`, `WeightSpace`
- Tangent bundle construction
- Differential operators

### LOW PRIORITY (Research-level connection)
13. **Hole 13** (line 893): Backpropagation flow

**KEY INSIGHT**: This is where our new `BellCategorical.agda` framework applies!
- Backprop differential (hole 10) = Bell's `derivative` in fork topos
- Natural transformation (hole 13) = Categorical chain rule
- **This connects Section 1.4 to our smooth infinitesimal analysis!**

---

## Connection to BellCategorical.agda

**The Big Picture**:
```
BellCategorical.agda
    ↓
    derivative : Hom R R → Hom R R
    chain-rule : (g ∘ f)' ≡ (g' ∘ f) · f'
    ↓
Architecture.agda Section 1.4
    ↓
    backprop-differential (hole 10)
    BackpropagationFlow (hole 13)
```

Once holes 3-12 are filled with manifold structures:
- `backprop-differential` = `derivative` from BellCategorical in fork topos
- `BackpropagationFlow` = Natural transformation via categorical chain rule
- **Theorem 1.1 becomes a special case of Bell's calculus in topoi!**

---

## Next Steps

### For completing Architecture.agda:
1. Fill holes 1-2 (sheafification) - ~100-150 lines each
2. Search 1Lab for reflective subcategory counit properties
3. Use explicit sheafification from paper (lines 572-579)

### For connecting to Bell framework:
1. Create `Neural/Smooth/ForkToposIsBell.agda`
2. Prove `BellTopos Sh[Fork-Category, fork-coverage]`
3. Show hole 10 = `derivative` in this topos
4. Show hole 13 = categorical chain rule

### For manifold infrastructure:
1. Extend `Neural/Smooth/Geometry.agda` with matrix manifolds
2. Define activity and weight manifolds concretely
3. Implement tangent bundles and differentials
4. Fill holes 3-12 using this infrastructure
