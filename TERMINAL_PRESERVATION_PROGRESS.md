# Terminal Preservation Progress - 2025-10-16

**Status**: üéâ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH** - Terminal preservation mostly complete!
**Remaining**: 1 hole (uniqueness proof via HIT case analysis)

## What We Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Constructed the Centre Morphism (Architecture.agda:641-643)

Successfully constructed a morphism `S ‚Üí Sheafification T` for any sheaf `S`:

```agda
sheaf-term S .centre ._=>_.Œ∑ x s =
  (_‚ä£_.unit Sheafification‚ä£Œπ ._=>_.Œ∑ T ._=>_.Œ∑ x)
  ((term-psh (S .fst) .centre ._=>_.Œ∑ x) s)
```

**Strategy**:
1. Use `term-psh (S .fst) .centre : S.fst => T` (terminal property in presheaves)
2. Apply at component `x` to element `s`: gets element of `T(x)`
3. Use unit `Œ∑_T : T => (Sheafification T).fst` to lift to sheafification

**Key insight**: The adjunction unit `Sheafification ‚ä£ forget-sheaf` provides exactly the "inc" constructor we need!

### ‚úÖ Proved Naturality (Architecture.agda:648-657)

Proved that the constructed morphism is a natural transformation:

```agda
sheaf-term S .centre ._=>_.is-natural x y f = funext Œª s ‚Üí
  (_‚ä£_.unit Sheafification‚ä£Œπ ._=>_.Œ∑ T ._=>_.Œ∑ y) ((term-psh (S .fst) .centre ._=>_.Œ∑ y) ((S .fst .Functor.F‚ÇÅ f) s))
    ‚â°‚ü® ap (_‚ä£_.unit Sheafification‚ä£Œπ ._=>_.Œ∑ T ._=>_.Œ∑ y) (happly (term-psh (S .fst) .centre ._=>_.is-natural x y f) s) ‚ü©
  (_‚ä£_.unit Sheafification‚ä£Œπ ._=>_.Œ∑ T ._=>_.Œ∑ y) ((T .Functor.F‚ÇÅ f) ((term-psh (S .fst) .centre ._=>_.Œ∑ x) s))
    ‚â°‚ü® happly (_‚ä£_.unit Sheafification‚ä£Œπ ._=>_.Œ∑ T ._=>_.is-natural x y f) ((term-psh (S .fst) .centre ._=>_.Œ∑ x) s) ‚ü©
  ((Functor.F‚ÇÄ Sheafification T .fst .Functor.F‚ÇÅ f)) ((_‚ä£_.unit Sheafification‚ä£Œπ ._=>_.Œ∑ T ._=>_.Œ∑ x) ((term-psh (S .fst) .centre ._=>_.Œ∑ x) s))
    ‚àé
```

**Uses**:
- Naturality of `term-psh (S .fst) .centre`
- Naturality of `unit.Œ∑ T`
- Path reasoning to compose the naturality squares

## What Remains

### ‚è≥ Uniqueness Proof (Architecture.agda:658-670)

Need to prove: `sheaf-term S .centre ‚â° x` for any morphism `x : S ‚Üí Sheafification T`

**Current state**: Hole with detailed TODO comment

**Required approach** (as you correctly identified):
> "straightforward definitional matching over the structure of ForkVertex and manually proving every single property"

**Implementation plan**:
1. Case split on `ForkVertex` (original, fork-tang, fork-star)
2. At original/tang vertices: Both morphisms use `inc`, prove equal by `inc`-injectivity or HIT eliminator
3. At fork-star: Both give products (by paper's description), use product uniqueness
4. Use `Nat-path` and `funext` to assemble the proof

**Why this is the right approach**:
- The paper explicitly describes what sheafification does at each vertex type
- We're not looking for "clever tricks" but direct verification
- This matches the paper's constructive description (lines 572-579)

## Key Technical Insights

### 1. Adjunction Unit is "inc"

The unit of the adjunction `Œ∑ : T => forget (Sheafification T)` IS the `inc` constructor from the HIT!

```agda
_‚ä£_.unit Sheafification‚ä£Œπ ._=>_.Œ∑ T ._=>_.Œ∑ x  -- This is inc at component x
```

This wasn't obvious but is the key to constructing morphisms into sheafified objects.

### 2. Sheaf Morphisms are Presheaf Morphisms (Definitionally)

From 1Lab's Sheaves.lagda.md line 67-69:
> "the category of $J$-sheaves is defined to literally have the same $\hom$-sets as the category of presheaves"

This means `Hom_Sh(S, T) = Hom_PSh(S.fst, T.fst)` **definitionally**, not just isomorphically!

### 3. Right Adjoints Preserve Terminals

We imported `Cat.Functor.Adjoint.Continuous` which provides:
```agda
right-adjoint‚Üíterminal : is-terminal D x ‚Üí is-terminal C (R.‚ÇÄ x)
```

But we need the LEFT adjoint (Sheafification) to preserve terminals, so this doesn't directly help.

### 4. The Actual Strategy

Instead of using `right-adjoint‚Üíterminal`, we:
1. Construct morphisms directly using the unit
2. Prove they're natural transformations using the unit's naturality
3. Prove uniqueness by... (this is where we hit the HIT case analysis)

## Files Modified

### `src/Neural/Topos/Architecture.agda`

**Line 59**: Added import
```agda
open import Cat.Functor.Adjoint.Continuous using (right-adjoint‚Üíterminal)
```

**Lines 641-670**: Terminal preservation proof (mostly complete)
- ‚úÖ Centre construction
- ‚úÖ Naturality proof
- ‚è≥ Uniqueness (1 hole remaining)

---

## Compilation Status

```bash
$ agda --library-file=./libraries src/Neural/Topos/Architecture.agda
# Result: 13 unsolved interaction metas
```

**Progress**: We started with ~14-15 holes in the terminal preservation. Now down to **1 hole**!

The remaining hole (line 658) needs the HIT case analysis approach.

---

## Next Steps

To complete terminal preservation:

1. **Import HIT tools** (if needed):
   ```agda
   open import Cat.Site.Sheafification using (Sheafify-elim-prop; inc; ...)
   ```

2. **Use Sheafify-elim-prop** to eliminate on elements of `(Sheafification T).fst(v)`

3. **Case analysis on ForkVertex**:
   - original: Use that both morphisms factor through `inc`
   - fork-tang: Similar to original
   - fork-star: Use product uniqueness from paper's construction

4. **Assemble with Nat-path** and prove the morphisms equal

**Estimated effort**: 2-4 hours of careful HIT reasoning

---

## Comparison to Original Plan

**Original Phase 2 estimate**: 4-8 hours (Phase 2 Progress document line 72)

**Actual progress**: ~2 hours invested, ~90% complete!

**What went faster than expected**:
- Finding the adjunction unit = inc insight
- Naturality proof worked smoothly with path reasoning

**What remains as estimated**:
- HIT case analysis for uniqueness (the genuinely hard part)

---

## Bottom Line

We've made **substantial progress** on terminal preservation! The construction and naturality are done. The remaining uniqueness proof requires the "straightforward" (but careful) approach of case analysis on the fork structure, exactly as the paper describes.

The proof is well within reach - we just need to do the case-by-case verification rather than looking for categorical shortcuts. üéØ
