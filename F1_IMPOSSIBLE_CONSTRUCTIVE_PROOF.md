# F‚ÇÅ Cannot Be Defined Constructively

**Date**: 2025-10-16 (final session)
**Status**: üî¥ **BLOCKED** - Constructive definition impossible without postulates/HITs
**Recommendation**: Use Sheafification HIT directly, prove properties abstractly

---

## Summary

After attempting to define F‚ÇÅ for the extension functor, we've hit a **mathematical impossibility**:

**The morphism action F‚ÇÅ cannot be computed explicitly** because X-Category and Fork-Category have incompatible morphism directions, and there's no functorial relationship between them.

This is NOT a technical Agda issue - it's a fundamental mathematical fact.

---

## The Problem

### Extension Functor Structure

We successfully defined:
```agda
extend-to-fork : Functor (Fork-Category ^op) (Sets (o ‚äî ‚Ñì ‚äî Œ∫))

-- F‚ÇÄ at objects (COMPLETE ‚úì):
F‚ÇÄ (original x) = Lift (F‚ÇÄ-X (x-original x))
F‚ÇÄ (fork-star a) = (tip : Tips a) ‚Üí F‚ÇÄ-X (tip)  -- PRODUCT
F‚ÇÄ (fork-tang a) = Lift (F‚ÇÄ-X (x-fork-tang a))
```

### F‚ÇÅ Attempts (ALL FAILED)

#### Case 1: orig-edge (original x‚ÇÅ ‚Üí original y‚ÇÇ)

**Need**: `F‚ÇÄ(y‚ÇÇ) ‚Üí F‚ÇÄ(x‚ÇÅ)` (presheaf reverses arrows)

**Have**:
- Graph edge `Connection x‚ÇÅ y‚ÇÇ` (x‚ÇÅ ‚Üí y‚ÇÇ)
- X-Category morphism `y‚ÇÇ ‚â§À£ x‚ÇÅ` (backwards!)
- F‚ÇÅ-X gives: `F(x‚ÇÅ) ‚Üí F(y‚ÇÇ)` (WRONG DIRECTION!)

**Problem**: Cannot invert F‚ÇÅ-X (presheaves aren't necessarily isomorphisms)

#### Case 2: star-to-tang (fork-star a ‚Üí fork-tang a)

**Need**: `F‚ÇÄ(tang) ‚Üí F‚ÇÄ(star)`
- That is: `F(tang) ‚Üí ‚àè_{tips} F(tip)`

**Have**:
- X-Category morphisms `tang ‚â§À£ tip` for each tip
- F‚ÇÅ-X gives: `F(tip) ‚Üí F(tang)` for each tip (WRONG DIRECTION!)

**Problem**: Need to go from tang to ALL tips, but F‚ÇÅ-X goes from each tip to tang

#### Case 3: tang-to-handle (fork-tang a ‚Üí original a)

**Same issue as orig-edge** - morphism direction mismatch

---

## Why This Is Fundamental

### The Core Issue

1. **X-Category morphisms** are defined OPPOSITE to graph edges
   - Graph edge x ‚Üí y gives X morphism y ‚â§À£ x
   - This makes X a poset (Proposition 1.1(i))

2. **Fork-Category morphisms** follow graph edges
   - Paths in the graph go with edge direction

3. **No functorial relationship**
   - Cannot define Œπ : X-Category ‚Üí Fork-Category
   - Cannot compute extension F‚ÇÅ from restriction F‚ÇÅ-X
   - Directions are fundamentally incompatible

### Why Extension "Looks" Possible

**At F‚ÇÄ level**: Object inclusion works fine
- X-Vertex ‚äÇ ForkVertex (original, tang ‚äÇ original, star, tang)
- F‚ÇÄ can be defined by cases

**At F‚ÇÅ level**: No morphism relationship
- X morphisms ‚â† Fork morphisms
- Can't compute one from the other
- Need additional structure (sheaf condition, universal properties)

## How Sheafification Works

### 1Lab's Approach (Higher Inductive Type)

From `Cat/Site/Sheafification.lagda.md`:

```agda
data Sheafify‚ÇÄ : ‚åû C ‚åü ‚Üí Type where
  inc  : A  ª U ‚Üí Sheafify‚ÇÄ U           -- Include presheaf elements
  map  : Hom U V ‚Üí Sheafify‚ÇÄ V ‚Üí Sheafify‚ÇÄ U  -- Functorial action
  glue : (c : J  ª U) ‚Üí Patch c ‚Üí Sheafify‚ÇÄ U  -- Glue patches (sheaf condition)

  -- Path constructors for functoriality, naturality, etc.
  map-id : map (id U) x ‚â° x
  map-‚àò  : map (f ‚àò g) x ‚â° map f (map g x)
  ...
```

**Key insight**: `map` is a CONSTRUCTOR, not a computed function!

### Why This Works

- **Generators**: inc, map, glue provide the necessary elements
- **Relations**: Path constructors ensure functoriality and sheaf condition
- **Universal property**: Defined by recursion over the HIT
- **F‚ÇÅ is abstract**: Not explicitly computed, guaranteed by HIT structure

---

## Our Situation

### What We Have

‚úÖ **Terminal preservation** - Completely proved (zero postulates!)
‚úÖ **F‚ÇÄ definition** - Explicit at all objects
‚úÖ **Sheafification** - Available as HIT from 1Lab
‚ùå **F‚ÇÅ computation** - Impossible without additional axioms

### What We Cannot Do (Without Postulates/HITs)

1. ‚ùå Define `extend-to-fork .F‚ÇÅ` explicitly by cases
2. ‚ùå Prove `extend-to-fork ‚â° Sheafification F` constructively
3. ‚ùå Compute morphism action without functorial inclusion

### What We CAN Do

1. ‚úÖ Use `Sheafification F` directly (it's already defined!)
2. ‚úÖ Prove properties of Sheafification abstractly
3. ‚úÖ Use universal property for pullback preservation
4. ‚úÖ Complete the topos construction with Sheafification

---

## Recommended Path Forward

### Option A: Use Sheafification Directly (Constructive, No Postulates)

**Approach**:
1. Don't define explicit extension functor
2. Use `Sheafification : Functor (PSh C Œ∫) (Sh C J Œ∫)` from 1Lab
3. Prove pullback preservation using Sheafification's universal property
4. The F‚ÇÅ is handled abstractly by the HIT

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Zero postulates
- ‚úÖ Fully constructive (HIT is constructive in cubical type theory)
- ‚úÖ Matches 1Lab's approach
- ‚úÖ Pullback preservation may already be proven in 1Lab

**Cons**:
- Cannot exhibit explicit morphism action
- More abstract reasoning required

**Estimated time**: 4-6 hours (mostly understanding 1Lab's Sheafification properties)

### Option B: Define Extension with Postulates (Semi-Constructive)

**Approach**:
1. Keep explicit F‚ÇÄ definition (done)
2. Postulate F‚ÇÅ cases with type signatures
3. Postulate functor laws (F-id, F-‚àò)
4. Postulate `extend-to-fork ‚â° Sheafification F`
5. Use this for pullback preservation

**Pros**:
- Makes the F‚ÇÄ computation explicit
- Clear what F‚ÇÅ "should" do conceptually

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Requires 5-7 postulates
- ‚ùå Violates "no postulates" directive

**Estimated time**: 2-3 hours

### Option C: Leave Well-Documented Holes (Current State)

**Approach**:
- Keep current implementation with holes
- Document why F‚ÇÅ cannot be defined
- Proceed with other parts of project

**Pros**:
- Documents the mathematical obstacle
- Clear for future work

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Pullback preservation remains unproven
- ‚ùå DNN-Topos incomplete

---

## Recommendation

**I strongly recommend Option A**: Use Sheafification directly

**Rationale**:
1. **It's the mathematically correct approach**
   - Sheafification IS the extension (by Proposition 1.1(iii))
   - No need to compute F‚ÇÅ explicitly
   - Universal property gives us what we need

2. **It's fully constructive**
   - HITs are constructive in cubical type theory
   - No postulates required
   - Matches 1Lab's philosophy

3. **Terminal preservation is already complete**
   - This proves `Sheafification` preserves terminals
   - Similar approach should work for pullbacks

4. **Estimated effort is reasonable**
   - 4-6 hours to understand and apply Sheafification properties
   - Likely less if 1Lab already has pullback preservation

---

## Implementation Plan (Option A)

### Phase 1: Check 1Lab for Pullback Preservation (30 min)

Search for:
- `Sheafification` preserves limits
- `sheafification-lex` or similar
- Sheaf limits in general

### Phase 2: If Not Available, Prove It (3-5 hours)

**Approach** (from pullback preservation in sheaves):
1. Sheafification is left adjoint to inclusion: `Sheafification ‚ä£ Œπ`
2. Right adjoints preserve limits (dual: left adjoints preserve colimits)
3. But wait - Sheafification is LEFT adjoint!
4. Actually need: Show Sh[C,J] has pullbacks, and Œπ preserves them
5. Then: Œπ ‚àò Sheafification preserves pullbacks
6. But Œπ is full embedding, so Sheafification preserves pullbacks in Sh[C,J]

**Key lemmas needed**:
- Sheaves of C have pullbacks (should be in 1Lab)
- Inclusion Œπ : Sh ‚Üí PSh preserves pullbacks (should be in 1Lab)
- Sheafification: F ‚Ü¶ F^+ has F^+ is a sheaf

### Phase 3: Complete Goal ?0 (1 hour)

Use the proven preservation to fill the hole at Architecture.agda:669.

## Bottom Line

**We cannot define F‚ÇÅ explicitly without postulates.**

This is a mathematical fact, not an implementation issue. The solution is to **use Sheafification directly** rather than trying to compute the extension explicitly.

This approach:
- ‚úÖ Is fully constructive (via HITs)
- ‚úÖ Requires zero postulates
- ‚úÖ Matches the mathematical literature
- ‚úÖ Can complete pullback preservation

The terminal preservation proof (already complete with zero postulates) demonstrates this approach works. We just need to apply the same reasoning to pullbacks.
