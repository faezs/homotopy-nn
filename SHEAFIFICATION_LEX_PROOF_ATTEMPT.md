# Sheafification Left-Exactness: Proof Attempt Report

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**File**: `src/Neural/Topos/Architecture.agda` (lines 635-700)
**Goal**: Prove `fork-sheafification-lex : is-lex Sheafification` WITHOUT postulates
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **BLOCKED** - Requires infrastructure not available in 1Lab

---

## Summary

Attempted to prove that sheafification preserves finite limits (terminals + pullbacks) for the fork topology using only computational/constructive methods (no postulates). This is **significantly more difficult** than initially anticipated.

**Key Finding**: Even the comprehensive 1Lab library (~10MB of formalized category theory) does NOT have a proof that sheafification is left-exact. This indicates the depth of the result.

---

## What We Tried

### Attempt 1: Transport via Adjunction Equivalence

**Idea**: Use `Sheafification ‚ä£ forget-sheaf` to transport contractibility of `Hom(F, T)` to `Hom(F, forget(Sheaf(T)))`.

**Code**:
```agda
morphism-space-contractible : is-contr (F => T-sheafified-underlying)
morphism-space-contractible =
  equiv‚Üíis-hlevel 0 (unit .Œ∑ T ‚àònt_) unit-precomp-equiv F-to-T-contractible
```

**Problem**: Proving `unit-precomp-equiv : is-equiv (unit .Œ∑ T ‚àònt_)` requires showing that precomposition with the adjunction unit is an equivalence. This is NOT true in general - the unit is only an isomorphism when applied to objects already in the reflective subcategory.

**Status**: ‚ùå This approach fundamentally doesn't work for arbitrary presheaves T.

---

### Attempt 2: Use Right Adjoint Preservation

**Idea**: Right adjoints preserve terminals (1Lab's `right-adjoint‚Üíterminal`). Maybe we can use the dual?

**Problem**: We need to show the LEFT adjoint (Sheafification) preserves terminals. Left adjoints preserve **colimits**, not limits! This is backwards.

**Status**: ‚ùå Wrong direction - can't use this lemma.

---

### Attempt 3: Reflective Subcategory Properties

**Idea**: Use the fact that sheaves form a reflective subcategory with counit isomorphism `Œµ : Sheafification ‚àò forget ‚âÖ‚Åø Id_Sh`.

**Attempted Proof Sketch**:
1. For sheaf F, show `Hom(F, Sheafification(T))` is contractible
2. Since Sh is full subcategory: `Hom_Sh(F, Sheaf(T)) = Hom_PSh(F, forget(Sheaf(T)))`
3. By adjunction: `Hom_PSh(F, forget(Sheaf(T))) ‚âÉ Hom_Sh(Sheaf(F), Sheaf(T))`
4. By reflectivity: `Sheaf(F) ‚âÖ F` (since F is already a sheaf)
5. So: `Hom_Sh(F, Sheaf(T)) ‚âÉ Hom_PSh(F, T)`, which is contractible!

**Problem**: Step 3 is the blocker. The adjunction gives:
```
Hom_Sh(Sheaf(T), F) ‚âÉ Hom_PSh(T, forget(F))
```
NOT
```
Hom_PSh(F, forget(Sheaf(T))) ‚âÉ Hom_Sh(Sheaf(F), Sheaf(T))
```

These are different directions and we can't just reverse the equivalence.

**Status**: ‚ùå Logical error in reasoning about adjunction direction.

## Why This Is Hard

### Mathematical Depth

**Theorem** (Johnstone's *Sketches of an Elephant*, A4.3.1):
> Sheafification functors are left-exact.

This is a **non-trivial result** even for experts. The proof requires:

1. **Understanding the HIT construction**: Sheafification in 1Lab is defined as a Higher Inductive Type with:
   - Point constructors for matching families
   - Path constructors for gluing
   - Sheaf condition as propositional truncation

2. **Proving preservation at each stage**: Must show that:
   - Matching families for terminals remain terminal
   - Gluing preserves terminal property
   - Same for pullbacks (even more complex)

3. **Limit-colimit interchange**: The sheafification construction involves both limits (matching) and colimits (gluing). Showing this preserves limits requires careful analysis.

### Why 1Lab Doesn't Have It

Looking at 1Lab's codebase:
- ‚úÖ Has: `Sh[]-terminal` (sheaves HAVE terminals)
- ‚úÖ Has: `PSh-terminal` (presheaves have terminals)
- ‚úÖ Has: `Sheafification‚ä£Œπ` (the adjunction)
- ‚úÖ Has: `is-reflective‚Üícounit-iso` (reflective properties)
- ‚ùå **Missing**: `Sheafification-preserves-terminals`
- ‚ùå **Missing**: `Sheafification-is-lex`

This is **NOT an oversight** - it's genuinely difficult to formalize!

## The Fork Topology Advantage

The paper (ToposOfDNNs.agda, lines 572-579) gives us a HUGE advantage:

> "The sheafification process... is **easy to describe**: no value is changed except at a place A‚òÖ, where X_A‚òÖ is replaced by the product X‚òÖ_A‚òÖ of the X_a'"

**Explicit Construction**:
```agda
Sheafify(F)(v) = F(v)                          -- original vertices: unchanged
Sheafify(F)(A) = F(A)                          -- fork-tang: unchanged
Sheafify(F)(A‚òÖ) = ‚àè_{a'‚ÜíA‚òÖ} F(a')             -- fork-star: PRODUCT!
```

**Why This Helps**:

### Terminal Preservation (Easier Case)

For terminal T where `T(x) ‚âÖ singleton` for all x:

```agda
Sheafify(T)(A‚òÖ) = ‚àè_{a'‚ÜíA‚òÖ} T(a')
                = ‚àè_{a'‚ÜíA‚òÖ} singleton
                ‚âÖ singleton                    -- products of contractibles are contractible!
```

Therefore `Sheafify(T)` is singleton everywhere ‚Üí still terminal! ‚úì

**Proof Sketch** (in Agda):
```agda
-- Lemma: Products of contractibles are contractible
Œ†-contractible : {I : Type} (A : I ‚Üí Type) ‚Üí (‚àÄ i ‚Üí is-contr (A i)) ‚Üí is-contr ((i : I) ‚Üí A i)

-- Apply to terminal object
fork-sheafification-pres-terminal : is-terminal PSh T ‚Üí is-terminal Sh (Sheafification.F‚ÇÄ T)
fork-sheafification-pres-terminal T-term (F, F-sheaf) =
  -- Show Hom(F, Sheafify(T)) is contractible by showing Sheafify(T) is singleton at each vertex
  transport is-contr (Sheafify(T) is singleton at v) (Œ†-contractible ...)
```

### Pullback Preservation (Harder Case)

For pullback P = X √ó_Y Z in presheaves:

```agda
Sheafify(P)(A‚òÖ) = ‚àè_{a'‚ÜíA‚òÖ} P(a')
                = ‚àè_{a'‚ÜíA‚òÖ} (X(a') √ó_{Y(a')} Z(a'))
                = (‚àè X(a')) √ó_{‚àè Y(a')} (‚àè Z(a'))        -- products preserve pullbacks!
                = Sheafify(X)(A‚òÖ) √ó_{Sheafify(Y)(A‚òÖ)} Sheafify(Z)(A‚òÖ)
```

Therefore sheafified diagram is still a pullback! ‚úì

**Key Lemma Needed**:
```agda
Œ†-preserves-pullbacks : {I : Type} ‚Üí Products preserve pullbacks
```

This is standard category theory but needs to be proven in 1Lab's framework.

## Three Paths Forward

### Option A: Postulate with Detailed Justification ‚ö†Ô∏è **PRAGMATIC**

**Pros**:
- Theorem A4.3.1 is a cornerstone of topos theory (well-established)
- Paper gives explicit construction for our case (lines 572-579)
- Allows immediate progress on other parts of project
- Honest about what's assumed vs. proven

**Cons**:
- No computational content (blocks extraction)
- User explicitly rejected this: "WE CAN'T USE POSTULATES THEY DON'T HAVE COMPUTATIONAL CONTENT"

**Implementation**:
```agda
-- Reference: Johnstone's "Sketches of an Elephant", Theorem A4.3.1
-- For fork-coverage, follows from explicit construction (paper lines 572-577)
-- Sheafification replaces A‚òÖ with products, and products preserve limits
postulate
  fork-sheafification-pres-‚ä§ : ...
  fork-sheafification-pres-pullback : ...
```

**Verdict**: ‚ùå **User explicitly rejected this approach**

---

### Option B: Explicit Fork Construction Proof üî® **USER'S CHOICE**

**Pros**:
- Fully constructive/computational
- Uses paper's explicit description (matches user's direction: "look into the paper")
- Leverages fork topology's simplicity
- Meaningful contribution (even 1Lab doesn't have this!)

**Cons**:
- Significant work (~300-500 lines of Agda)
- Requires several helper lemmas not in 1Lab
- May encounter technical issues with HIT reasoning
- Timeline: Several hours to days of focused work

**Required Steps**:

1. **Prove products-preserve-contractibles** (~30 lines)
   ```agda
   Œ†-is-contr : {I : Type} (A : I ‚Üí Type) ‚Üí (‚àÄ i ‚Üí is-contr (A i)) ‚Üí is-contr ((i : I) ‚Üí A i)
   ```

2. **Prove explicit-sheafification-equals-HIT** (~100 lines) üî• **HARDEST PART**
   ```agda
   fork-sheafification-explicit
     : (F : Presheaf) (v : ForkVertex)
     ‚Üí Sheafification.F‚ÇÄ F v ‚â° (if is-fork-star v then ‚àè F(incoming v) else F(v))
   ```
   This requires deep reasoning about the HIT constructors!

3. **Prove terminal-preservation-via-product** (~50 lines)
   ```agda
   fork-sheafification-pres-‚ä§ : ...
   fork-sheafification-pres-‚ä§ T-term (F, F-sheaf) =
     use explicit-sheafification-equals-HIT
     show Sheafification.F‚ÇÄ T = singleton at all vertices
     use Œ†-is-contr at fork-stars
   ```

4. **Prove products-preserve-pullbacks** (~80 lines)
   ```agda
   Œ†-preserves-pullbacks
     : {I : Type} {X Y Z : I ‚Üí Type} {f : ‚àÄ i ‚Üí X i ‚Üí Y i} {g : ‚àÄ i ‚Üí Z i ‚Üí Y i}
     ‚Üí (‚àÄ i ‚Üí is-pullback (X i) (Y i) (Z i) (f i) (g i))
     ‚Üí is-pullback (Œ† X) (Œ† Y) (Œ† Z) (Œ†-map f) (Œ†-map g)
   ```

5. **Prove pullback-preservation-via-product** (~100 lines)
   ```agda
   fork-sheafification-pres-pullback : ...
   ```

6. **Assemble is-lex proof** (~30 lines)
   ```agda
   fork-sheafification-lex : is-lex Sheafification
   fork-sheafification-lex .pres-‚ä§ = fork-sheafification-pres-‚ä§
   fork-sheafification-lex .pres-pullback = fork-sheafification-pres-pullback
   ```

**Estimated Effort**: 300-500 lines, 8-16 hours of focused work

**Risks**:
- HIT definitional equality issues
- Universe level complications
- May discover the construction is harder than paper suggests

**Verdict**: ‚úÖ **This is what the user wants ("Option B")**

---

### Option C: Hybrid - Partial Proof + Documented Holes üéØ **RECOMMENDED COMPROMISE**

**Idea**: Implement as much as possible constructively, leaving clearly-marked holes for the genuinely difficult parts.

**Implementation**:
```agda
fork-sheafification-pres-‚ä§ : ...
fork-sheafification-pres-‚ä§ T-term (F, F-sheaf) =
  transport is-contr sheafified-is-singleton F-to-T-contractible
  where
    sheafified-is-singleton : Sheafification.F‚ÇÄ T ‚âÖ Œª v ‚Üí singleton
    sheafified-is-singleton =
      {!!}  -- HOLE 1: Show explicit construction equals HIT
            -- Requires: fork-sheafification-explicit lemma
            -- This is the deep HIT reasoning part

    Œ†-singleton-is-singleton : is-contr ((i : I) ‚Üí singleton)
    Œ†-singleton-is-singleton = {!!}  -- HOLE 2: Products of contractibles
                                     -- This is straightforward, just needs doing
```

**Pros**:
- Makes progress immediately
- Clearly documents what's missing
- Holes can be filled incrementally
- Shows the proof structure even if incomplete

**Cons**:
- File won't fully type-check (with --allow-unsolved-metas)
- Still no computational content for blocked parts

**Verdict**: ‚≠ê **Good middle ground if Option B takes too long**

---

## Recommendation

Given user's explicit requirement: **"Option B. WE WANT TO CALCULATE WE CAN'T USE POSTULATES THEY DON'T HAVE COMPUTATIONAL CONTENT"**

**Primary Path**: Option B (Explicit Fork Construction Proof)

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Document current state (this file!)
2. Start with `Œ†-is-contr` lemma (easiest part, ~30 lines)
3. Tackle `fork-sheafification-explicit` (hardest part, may need 1Lab experts)
4. If stuck on HIT reasoning, pivot to Option C (partial proof)

**Timeline Estimate**:
- Optimistic: 8 hours (if HIT reasoning goes smoothly)
- Realistic: 16 hours (if we hit technical issues)
- Pessimistic: 3-4 days (if fundamental blockers)

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Terminal preservation: `pres-‚ä§` proven without holes
- ‚úÖ Pullback preservation: `pres-pullback` proven without holes
- ‚úÖ File type-checks with `agda --library-file=./libraries`
- ‚úÖ No postulates in proof path
