## Critical Path Analysis

### What Needs to be Proven for Demo Validity

**To make ConsciousnessDemo.agda legitimate:**

1. **feedforward-zero-Φ** (IntegratedInformation.agda:297)
   - Currently postulated
   - This is Lemma 8.1 from the paper
   - **Without this, the entire demo is hollow**

2. **FeedforwardStructure** properties
   - State partition existence
   - Reducibility proof

3. **Φ-hopfield** definition correctness
   - Mutual information decomposition
   - Earth mover distance properties

### What Could Be Proven (Easier)

1. **Shannon entropy basic properties**
   - Non-negativity
   - Zero iff deterministic
   - Additivity for independent variables

2. **Category constructions**
   - Functoriality proofs
   - Composition laws

3. **Simple graph properties**
   - Acyclic graphs
   - Path existence

### What's Very Hard (Mathematical Research)

1. **Information cohomology**
   - Novel construction from Bradley
   - Not in standard references

2. **Homotopy-theoretic structures**
   - Requires substantial topology background
   - Spectrum constructions are advanced

3. **Unified framework**
   - Research-level mathematics
   - Connections not fully understood

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Priority 1: Make the Demo Valid
**Prove feedforward-zero-Φ** (or admit it's postulated in the demo)

### Priority 2: Fill Basic Gaps
- Shannon entropy properties
- Simple graph algorithms
- Category functoriality

### Priority 3: Document Clearly
- Mark which theorems are "claimed from paper"
- Mark which are "should be provable"
- Mark which are "research-level hard"

### Priority 4: Strategic Postulates
- Some things (like graph reachability) could use external libraries
- Some things (like spectrum theory) may need axioms
- Be clear about which is which

## Assessment

**What we have:**
- Comprehensive formal framework (~9000 lines)
- Correct type signatures and structures
- Well-organized module hierarchy
- Compilable code

**What we're missing:**
- Most theorem proofs
- The KEY theorem (feedforward → Φ=0)
- Mathematical infrastructure (graph theory, measure theory)

**For hiring purposes:**
This demonstrates ability to formalize sophisticated mathematics, but
honest disclosure of postulates is essential.

**For academic purposes:**
This is a substantial formalization effort, but would need significant
proof work to be publishable.
