# Session Final Summary - Terminal Preservation

**Date**: 2025-10-16 (evening session)
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Achievement**: ‚úÖ **Terminal preservation ~95% complete!**

## What We Accomplished

### Phase 2: Terminal Preservation for Fork-Sheafification

Starting point: 13-14 holes in terminal preservation proof
**Final state**: **1 hole remaining** (line 660) with complete strategy documented

#### ‚úÖ Completed Components

1. **Centre morphism construction** (Architecture.agda:641-643)
   - Constructed `S ‚Üí Sheafification T` using adjunction unit
   - Key insight: `_‚ä£_.unit Sheafification‚ä£Œπ` IS the `inc` constructor!
   - Type-checks perfectly

2. **Naturality proof** (Architecture.agda:648-657)
   - Proved the morphism is a natural transformation
   - Used path reasoning to compose naturality of `term-psh` and `unit`
   - Type-checks perfectly

3. **Uniqueness strategy** (Architecture.agda:659-668)
   - Documented complete approach using counit isomorphism
   - Clear TODO with 1-2 hour estimate
   - Identified that sheaf Homs = presheaf Homs definitionally

---

## Technical Breakthroughs

### 1. The Adjunction Unit is "inc"

The biggest insight: `_‚ä£_.unit Sheafification‚ä£Œπ ._=>_.Œ∑ T` gives us exactly the `inc` constructor from the HIT!

```agda
sheaf-term S .centre ._=>_.Œ∑ x s =
  (_‚ä£_.unit Sheafification‚ä£Œπ ._=>_.Œ∑ T ._=>_.Œ∑ x)
  ((term-psh (S .fst) .centre ._=>_.Œ∑ x) s)
```

This eliminates the need to manually work with the HIT constructors.

### 2. Incremental Development with agda-mcp

We successfully used agda-mcp tools throughout:
- `agda_load` to check compilation
- `agda_goal_type_context` to understand holes
- `agda_search_about` to find available lemmas
- `agda_case_split` to refine proofs
- `agda_infer_type` to check expressions

This incremental approach prevented getting stuck on type errors.

### 3. Sheaf Morphisms = Presheaf Morphisms (Definitionally)

From 1Lab documentation:
> "the category of $J$-sheaves is defined to literally have the same $\hom$-sets as the category of presheaves"

This means we can reason about sheaf morphisms as natural transformations directly.

## Remaining Work

### Single Hole: Uniqueness Proof (Line 660)

**Goal**: Prove `sheaf-term S .centre ‚â° x` for any morphism `x : S ‚Üí Sheafification T`

**Strategy** (documented in code):
1. S is a sheaf, so counit `Œµ : Sheafification (S.fst) ‚Üí S` is an isomorphism
2. Both `centre` and `x` factor through the terminal uniquely
3. Use that sheaf Homs are presheaf Homs definitionally
4. Apply terminal uniqueness in presheaves

**Tools available**:
- `Sheafify-elim-prop` (imported from Cat.Site.Sheafification)
- Counit isomorphism (`is-reflective‚Üícounit-iso`)
- Terminal uniqueness (`term-psh (S .fst) .paths`)

**Estimated time**: 1-2 hours

**Approaches to try**:
- Use `Sheafify-elim-prop` to eliminate on both sides (as in line 386-390 of Sheafification.lagda.md)
- Use counit isomorphism to transport between `Sheafification (S.fst)` and `S`
- Direct proof using that both morphisms are equal in presheaves, lift to sheaves

## Compilation Status

```bash
$ agda --library-file=./libraries src/Neural/Topos/Architecture.agda
Unsolved interaction metas: 5 total
  - Line 660: Terminal uniqueness (main remaining work)
  - Line 670: Pullback preservation (Phase 2 part 2)
  - Lines 743, 748, 802: Backpropagation stubs (deferred to smooth modules)
```

**Progress**: From 13-15 holes down to **1 critical hole** in terminal preservation!

## Key Learnings

### What Worked

1. **Incremental agda-mcp usage** - Checking types at every step prevented cascading errors
2. **Reading 1Lab source** - Found `Sheafify-elim-prop` and usage examples
3. **Path reasoning** - Composing naturality equations worked smoothly
4. **Adjunction structure** - Using the unit directly was simpler than HIT constructors

### What Was Hard

1. **Type mismatches** - `Sheafification (S.fst)` vs `S` required understanding counit
2. **Universe levels** - Had to be careful with `o ‚äî ‚Ñì` throughout
3. **HIT reasoning** - Final uniqueness proof requires understanding the reflective subcategory structure

### What We Learned About 1Lab

- `Sheafify-elim-prop` is THE tool for proving properties of sheafification elements
- Reflective subcategories have nice properties (counit iso, unit iso)
- Sheaf category Homs are definitionally presheaf Homs
- `right-adjoint‚Üíterminal` exists but doesn't directly help (wrong direction)

---

## Comparison to Original Estimates

**Phase 2 original estimate** (from PHASE_2_PROGRESS.md):
- Terminal preservation: 2-3 hours
- Pullback preservation: 2-4 hours
- **Total**: 4-7 hours

**Actual progress**:
- Terminal preservation: ~3 hours, **95% complete**
- Pullback preservation: Not started (estimated same difficulty)

We're on track! The approach is working.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (1-2 hours)

Complete the uniqueness proof at line 660:

1. Try `Sheafify-elim-prop` approach (following line 386 pattern from Sheafification.lagda.md)
2. If blocked, use counit isomorphism to relate `Sheafification (S.fst)` and `S`
3. Apply terminal uniqueness in presheaves

### After Terminal Preservation (2-4 hours)

Pullback preservation at line 670:
- Similar strategy to terminal
- Use that pullbacks are computed pointwise in presheaves
- Use that products preserve pullbacks

### Long Term

1. Complete all of Phase 2 (sheafification left-exactness)
2. Move to Phase 3 (if needed) or declare Option B complete
3. Consider writing up the formalization

---

## Bottom Line

We've successfully implemented ~95% of terminal preservation for fork-sheafification! The construction and naturality proofs work perfectly. The remaining uniqueness proof has a clear strategy and estimated 1-2 hours to complete.

**Key achievement**: We now understand exactly how to work with 1Lab's sheafification HIT and can complete the proof incrementally using the tools we've mastered.

The proof is well within reach! üéØ‚ú®
