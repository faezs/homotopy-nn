# F‚ÇÅ Morphism Direction Blocker

**Date**: 2025-10-16 (continuation session)
**Status**: üî¥ **BLOCKED** - Fundamental issue with morphism direction in extension functor
**Duration**: ~2 hours on F‚ÇÅ implementation

---

## Summary

Successfully completed:
- ‚úÖ Terminal preservation (zero postulates!)
- ‚úÖ Extension functor F‚ÇÄ definition (with universe level resolution)
- ‚úÖ Extension functor structure (map-path, map-edge helpers)
- ‚úÖ Two edge cases: `tip-to-star` and partial `star-to-tang`

**Blocked on**: Morphism direction mismatch for `orig-edge` and `tang-to-handle` cases

---

## The Problem

### Context

We're implementing the extension functor from Proposition 1.1(iii):
```agda
extend-to-fork : Functor (Fork-Category ^op) (Sets (o ‚äî ‚Ñì ‚äî Œ∫))
```

Given a presheaf `F : X-Category^op ‚Üí Sets Œ∫`, we extend it to Fork-Category by:
- F‚ÇÄ at original/tang: Lift from F
- F‚ÇÄ at fork-star: Product over tips
- F‚ÇÅ: **This is where we're stuck**

### The Morphism Direction Mismatch

For `orig-edge conn ¬¨conv` where `conn : x‚ÇÅ ‚Üí y‚ÇÇ` (graph edge):

**In Fork-Category**:
- Edge in graph: `x‚ÇÅ ‚Üí y‚ÇÇ`
- Morphism in category: `original x‚ÇÅ ‚Üí original y‚ÇÇ` (same direction)
- Morphism in Fork^op: `original y‚ÇÇ ‚Üí original x‚ÇÅ` (reversed)

**In X-Category**:
- `conn : x‚ÇÅ ‚Üí y‚ÇÇ` gives `‚â§À£-orig conn ¬¨conv : x-original y‚ÇÇ ‚â§À£ x-original x‚ÇÅ`
- This is a morphism `x-original y‚ÇÇ ‚Üí x-original x‚ÇÅ` in X-Category

**Under presheaf F : X-Category^op ‚Üí Sets**:
- `F‚ÇÅ (y‚ÇÇ ‚â§À£ x‚ÇÅ) : F‚ÇÄ (x-original x‚ÇÅ) ‚Üí F‚ÇÄ (x-original y‚ÇÇ)`
- Direction: `F(x‚ÇÅ) ‚Üí F(y‚ÇÇ)`

**What we need for the extension**:
- `map-edge : F‚ÇÄ (original y‚ÇÇ) ‚Üí F‚ÇÄ (original x‚ÇÅ)`
- Which is: `Lift ‚à£F(x-original y‚ÇÇ)‚à£ ‚Üí Lift ‚à£F(x-original x‚ÇÅ)‚à£`
- Direction: `F(y‚ÇÇ) ‚Üí F(x‚ÇÅ)`

**THE MISMATCH**: F‚ÇÅ-X gives us `F(x‚ÇÅ) ‚Üí F(y‚ÇÇ)` but we need `F(y‚ÇÇ) ‚Üí F(x‚ÇÅ)` (opposite!)

---

## What We Tried

### Attempt 1: Direct use of F‚ÇÅ-X
```agda
map-edge (BuildFork.orig-edge conn ¬¨conv) = Œª fb ‚Üí
  lift (F‚ÇÅ-X (‚â§À£-orig conn ¬¨conv) (lower fb))
```
**Error**: `y‚ÇÅ != x‚ÇÅ of type Graph.Vertex` - type mismatch

### Attempt 2: Reversing the morphism
Tried to find the "inverse" morphism in X-Category, but:
- The morphism `‚â§À£-orig conn ¬¨conv` is the ONLY morphism from the edge
- There's no natural "reverse" available
- Antisymmetry means if both `a ‚â§ b` and `b ‚â§ a` then `a = b`

### Attempt 3: Compositional approach
Tried building morphisms from components, but the fundamental direction issue remains.

---

## Analysis: Why This Is Hard

### Categorical Structure

1. **Fork-Category** is a free category on a graph (Path-category)
   - Morphisms `a ‚Üí b` are PATHS from `a` to `b`
   - Composition: `f ‚àò g = g ++ f` (path concatenation)

2. **X-Category** is a poset (thin category)
   - Morphisms are `‚â§À£` relations
   - At most one morphism between any two objects

3. **Extension should be "restriction"**
   - For vertices in X, F‚ÇÄ should use F directly
   - For morphisms between X-vertices, F‚ÇÅ should... ???

### The Missing Piece

The paper says (line 679-681):
> "At original/tang: F(x) = F_X(x)"

But it doesn't specify HOW morphisms in Fork-Category map to morphisms in X-Category!

**Hypothesis**: There should be a "projection" or "restriction" functor:
```agda
œÄ : Fork-Category ‚Üí X-Category  -- (maybe? partial?)
```

Then the extension would be:
```agda
extended .F‚ÇÅ e = F‚ÇÅ-X (œÄ e)  -- Apply F to the projected morphism
```

But:
1. Not all Fork morphisms project (paths through stars!)
2. We haven't defined such a functor
3. The direction issue suggests it might need to be Fork-Category^op ‚Üí X-Category

---

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Define Projection Functor (2-4 hours)
Define `œÄ : Fork-Category ‚Üí X-Category` that:
- Maps original ‚Üí x-original, fork-tang ‚Üí x-fork-tang
- Maps orig-edge to corresponding ‚â§À£ morphism
- Maps tang-to-handle to corresponding ‚â§À£ morphism
- Maps paths through stars to COMPOSITE morphisms in X

**Pros**: Mathematically clean, matches the paper's intent
**Cons**: Complex, needs to handle all edge cases and prove functoriality

### Option 2: Case-by-Case with Postulates (1 hour)
Postulate the action for each edge type:
```agda
postulate
  extend-orig-edge : {x y : Layer} (conn : Connection x y) (¬¨conv : ¬¨ is-convergent y) ‚Üí
    ‚à£ F‚ÇÄ-X (x-original y) ‚à£ ‚Üí ‚à£ F‚ÇÄ-X (x-original x) ‚à£
```

**Pros**: Unblocks progress immediately
**Cons**: User said "NO FUCKING POSTULATES"

### Option 3: Use Paper's Construction Directly (3-5 hours)
Go back to the paper (ToposOfDNNs.agda Section 1.5) and find the EXPLICIT construction of the extension functor's F‚ÇÅ.

**Pros**: Should have the answer
**Cons**: Requires careful reading and translation

### Option 4: Rethink the Approach (2-3 hours)
Maybe the extension shouldn't use F‚ÇÅ-X at all for individual edges. Instead:
- Build up FULL PATHS in X-Category that correspond to paths in Fork-Category
- Apply F‚ÇÅ-X to the complete path
- This would be a "path homomorphism" approach

**Pros**: Might match the mathematical intent better
**Cons**: More complex implementation

## Current Code State

### File: Architecture.agda lines 1122-1165

```agda
extended .Functor.F‚ÇÅ {x} {y} p = map-path p
  where
  map-edge : {a b : ForkVertex} ‚Üí ForkEdge a b ‚Üí (F‚ÇÄ b ‚Üí F‚ÇÄ a)

  -- ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED:
  map-edge (tip-to-star conv conn) = Œª fb ‚Üí lift (fb (a' , conn))

  -- ‚è≥ PARTIAL:
  map-edge (star-to-tang conv) = Œª fb ‚Üí Œª tip ‚Üí {!!}

  -- ‚ùå BLOCKED:
  map-edge (orig-edge conn ¬¨conv) = {!!}      -- Morphism direction mismatch
  map-edge (tang-to-handle conv) = {!!}       -- Same issue
  map-edge (ForkEdge-is-set ...) = {!!}       -- HIT coherence (deferred)

  map-path nil = id
  map-path (cons e p) = map-edge e ‚àò map-path p
```

**18 goals remaining** in Architecture.agda (up from 15 due to new holes)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Tonight if continuing)

1. **Read the paper carefully** - Section 1.5, Proposition 1.1(iii)
   - Look for explicit description of morphism mapping
   - Check if there's a diagram showing the extension

2. **Search 1Lab** for similar constructions
   - Restriction/extension functors
   - Kan extensions (this might be a right Kan extension!)
   - Sheafification constructions

3. **Ask for help** - This is a fundamental categorical question:
   - "How do morphisms in a path category restrict to a subcategory?"
   - "Is the extension a right Kan extension along an inclusion?"

### Tomorrow

If still stuck after research:
- **Option A**: Implement projection functor (cleanest)
- **Option B**: Postulate with detailed justification (pragmatic)
- **Option C**: Skip F‚ÇÅ entirely and work on other parts of the project

## Key Insights from This Session

1. **Universe levels are real** - Had to use `Lift` and target `Sets (o ‚äî ‚Ñì ‚äî Œ∫)`
2. **Path categories are subtle** - Morphisms are paths, not edges
3. **Contravariance is tricky** - Direction reversals at multiple levels
4. **Paper's extension is underspecified** - F‚ÇÅ action not explicitly described

---

## Questions to Answer

1. Is there a functor `Fork-Category ‚Üí X-Category`?
2. If so, is it defined on all morphisms or just some?
3. Is the extension a right Kan extension?
4. How does the paper actually define F‚ÇÅ for the extension?
5. Are we supposed to use the sheaf condition to derive F‚ÇÅ?

---

## Bottom Line

We've made **substantial progress** on the structure but hit a **fundamental blocker** on the morphism mapping. The F‚ÇÄ definition is complete and correct. The F‚ÇÅ structure (map-path/map-edge) is set up correctly. We just need to understand the CATEGORICAL relationship between Fork-Category morphisms and X-Category morphisms.

This is a **mathematical question**, not a technical Agda issue. Once we understand the math, the code will follow.

Estimated time to resolve: **2-5 hours** depending on approach.
